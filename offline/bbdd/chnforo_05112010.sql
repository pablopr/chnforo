Liberal free software license agreement allows the software development community to do better. Free and open source software development to encourage genuine, attentive, and the strength of the volunteer activities of participants as &quot;open heart&quot; campaign, as the software companies can sell services and &quot;enterprise-class software functionality,&quot; and do not change into a single individual to master all the important rights of software.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">I have to honest - I\'m not very keen on the Java language - I prefer to use Python, Javascript, C, C + +, PHP and even write a program, but I found that Java is everywhere, I fell.

In the past, Motif (before the LessTif) and Qt (the developers to its free before) the major problems are arising in this regard. Most 3D graphics are dependent on non-free driver, also have this problem. But now, the biggest problem has come from Java, because the development of free software Java people are great feeling.

It turned out to 70-80 years to the 20th century, almost all of the most significant invention of the computer, the great business stories, and other commercial open source movement closely linked to the war, witnessed a period of IT industry and a legend. <br /><br /> In 1969, Ken Thompson of Bell Labs to his beloved game to develop a new operating environment, and Dennis Ritchie to design a set of operating system called UNICS (later homonym taken as &quot;UNIX&quot;). R &amp; D results in this casual, but the computer field has opened up dramatically in the new world. <br /><br /> In the course of development of UNIX in the past forty years, never stopped crowded situation. Which last for decades between the two giants of war, as the industry made an indelible contribution. Today, customers are going to review IT is such a history has been settled, from the brilliant to the bottom, from the equal strength to the great disparities between the success or failure in that study. <br /><br /> Two giants, two peak showdown <br /><br /> If the IT industry in 2009 to make a ranking event occurs, then the &quot;big S&quot; the company was acquired events, will be able to squeeze into the top three. &quot;Big S&quot; which was once only in Silicon Valley with the &quot;Big I&quot; standing shoulder to shoulder of giants, and now the setting sun, had to make people regret the ever-changing shopping contest. What kind of events completely changed the &quot;Big S&quot; development path? What kind of competition is completely defeated &quot;Big S&quot; line of defense? <br /><br /> The first battle - UNIX separatist war <br /><br /> Early 80s, the face of fast-growing IT market in the computer information industry vendors, in pursuit of product differentiation and added value, have improved UNIX, derived from a variety of commercial UNIX versions, fully started the UNIX market battle . <br /><br /> In 1982, the station started the &quot;Big S&quot; ascended the stage of history. Derived from the UNIX operating system version of the introduction to the Java programming language and J2EE (Java2EnerpriseEdition) application platform launched, &quot;Big S&quot; greatly contributed to the development of business applications. Improved through continuous updates, the company\'s Solaris operating system has made considerable progress can be broad support for UNIX-based business applications. Meanwhile, the firm\'s market share, R &amp; D investment in time, well-trained staff, excellent business advice, so that the &quot;Big S&quot; made a brilliant market performance, becoming the most dynamic UNIX commercial manufacturers. However, as the most promising one of the commercial versions of UNIX, Solaris itself brought poor standard software, the optional and very expensive package, which affect the company\'s future development as a major drawback. <br /><br /> January 1986, &quot;Big I&quot; the birth of the company\'s AIX operating system. Since then, it take up a UNIX server platform to create the task, has become a &quot;Big I&quot; open systems and standards for companies to enter the world of the catalyst. With the continuing escalation of AIX version, which gradually version of Java2 support, and provide improved tools for load management applications, in business and government sectors to show their talents. Meanwhile, AIX performance in terms of security but also reputation, AIX4.3 became the first TCSECC2 the U.S. National Security Agency and the German Information Technology Security Certification Authority E3F-C2-certified 64-bit UNIX systems, the field in the UNIX market performance extraordinary. And &quot;Big S&quot; than the company\'s Solaris, AIX has a large database and development tools, the user can choose in addition to the existing application software can also be developed according to their needs, which is the &quot;big I&quot; company is a major lead, but also to promote sustainable and stable development of its future an important factor. <br /><br /> Especially noteworthy is the highlight AIX powerful is a landmark event. May 11, 1997, 4:50, world chess champion Garry Kasparov in with one called &quot;Deep Blue&quot; supercomputer through six innings against, the final hand over to concede defeat. The claims of the most intelligent person, Bureau of 2.5 pairs of 2.5 in the first five cases tie, deciding game in the sixth disc only 19 steps away to defeat at the hands of blue. This station is running the computer Deep Blue was the best commercial UNIX operating system - &quot;Big I&quot; of the AIX. <br /><br /> Battle in the UNIX market, the &quot;Big S&quot; a rapid response to make it to seize the opportunities, even in the &quot;Big I&quot; catch up time, still can not shake the &quot;Big S&quot; a brilliant performance, both through the eventual realization of a separatist war in the market to keep pace.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">The second confrontation - Processor Dispute <br /><br /> However, in the processors, the face of &quot;Big I&quot; strong technical innovation, &quot;Big S&quot; did not effectively countered the decline of the future foreshadowed. Whether to firmly grasp the leading edge of technological innovation, and has sufficient capital support, the business of winning opponents. <br /><br /> 80 20th century, is RISC (reduced instruction set computer) processor era. In 1984, the &quot;Big S&quot; of the SPARC architecture proposed; 1987, the first SPARC processor come out and quickly capture the market, to help the &quot;big S&quot; exceeded 10 billion revenue mark; in 1995, 64 UltraSPARCI the company microprocessor technology to achieve a qualitative leap; 1999, was a great success of the UltraSPARC-III, a &quot;Big S&quot; a milestone in the history of the microprocessor; 2005, 8-core 32-thread UltraSPARC-T1 launched; 2008 -2009, the 16-core &quot;Rock&quot; Ship Even Sank, this after 5 years, invested billions of dollars of products in the development process has some serious performance issues. Continuous deficit for the &quot;big S&quot; inability to continue to afford the high development costs, the outcome of the acquisition, but also to the future of this product has become more complicated and confusing. <br /><br /> In 1980, the &quot;Big I&quot; invented a prototype based on RISC architecture, microprocessor architecture to create a new heaven and earth; 1990, the &quot;Big I&quot; launched a RISC-based systems POWER1, officially opened the Power family genealogy brilliant prelude , since each generation of Power processors have created amazing success, has been at the pinnacle of processors. In 1997, based on the POWER2 architecture &quot;Deep Blue&quot; computer made the victory of man-machine war, is considered a milestone in the history of computer development; 1998, POWER3 processor and the subsequent update, the speed of the processor frequency shine ; 2001, the &quot;Big I&quot; am the history of mankind\'s first dual-core processor POWER4; 2007Ã¥Â¹Â´, POWER6 processor performance and speed and no one can, technically ahead by 2-3 in a processor market Pioneer; 2010, POWER78 core processors debut as a beautiful dawn, in the number of cores, chip design, operation speed, performance and other aspects of the work demonstrated an unrivaled advantage. <br /><br /> And &quot;Big S&quot; than the company\'s SPARC processor, &quot;Big I&quot; the company\'s POWER processors have no king to shake the status of the technology. With the industry\'s most robust product development roadmap, continuous research and development, advancing with a powerful innovation, &quot;Big I&quot; continue to inject fresh blood into the server market, to fully protect your investment, overall achievements in technology, performance and market leadership position. Processors, the war, the decisive opened the distance between the two giants, the &quot;Big S&quot; from glory into the bottom. <br /><br /> Fallen star, is lost to technology or capital loss? <br /><br /> SPARC twenty-five years of ups and downs, laid the &quot;Big S&quot; in the high-end microprocessor market leader, however, focusing as much on high-end server hardware and software development of the &quot;behind closed doors&quot; strategy, as well as hardware products are daily necessities of the trend, but as always, the standard of sales and production based on traditional general-purpose servers, the &quot;Big S&quot; has separated itself from the trend of industrial development, missed a good opportunity for development. Meanwhile, the high R &amp; D investment and market performance unsatisfactory, but also the &quot;big S&quot; the two most troublesome issues. <br /><br /> Recalling the most glorious era, in September 2000, &quot;Big S&quot; in the stock price close to 260 dollars, but the advanced information technology company in a very long period of time are not aware of the need with the times, when the elephants learn to dance &quot;Big I&quot; has an annual turnover of billions of dollars into the threshold, the &quot;Big S&quot; but with billions of dollars in market value of the club further away. In the financial crisis, business difficulties, large fund companies to sell shares under the influence of multiple factors such as, &quot;Big S&quot; performance gradually decline and eventually become a takeover target. Compete with the capital markets, technology sometimes have to yield to capital, because technological innovation can not do without the support of the capital. <br /><br /> Founded in 1982, was acquired in 2009, with the former glory, &quot;Big S&quot; slowly fade out of sight. In the future, &quot;Big S&quot; in the hardware business will go from here? Face the loss of personnel and their customers, &quot;Big S&quot; turn Zuoheganxiang? Regardless of whether the problem is solvable, it is always worth the contribution of the industry people to admire.

Some critics are very sincere and hit crucial point, and some entirely groundless, incorrectly relay an erroneous.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">First, the opening is not a simple concept.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Before the advent of smart phones, mobile phone operating system manufacturers are often private, above the built-in software is often the only manufacturer to develop the above procedures, but most machines do not support installing new software. This is the real closed.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">With smart phones, though a large number of platforms and languages we can use, but did not actually form a robust application development market.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">J2ME applications to the mobile phone market had illusions of prosperity. But in fact, on the one hand, in order to ensure compatibility, J2ME give up a lot of features, performance and application scenarios are greatly limited, difficult to develop and sell the user a powerful and easy to use program.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">In another aspect, it is no perfect interface and operational standards, support of various kinds of mobile phones, the fact of the compatibility and completely can not be guaranteed, few programs can really be the perfect support for a variety of mobile phones particular game type applications, really be compatible with a variety of mobile phone rare.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Nokia S40 and S60 adhere to the two fronts, on the standardization and product diversity to achieve a relatively good balance. Once considered the savior of mobile applications market, however, the past 10 years, Nokia\'s mobile phones although the appearance of each passing day, but the software and operating system improvements inadequate. And the difficulty of system development has been too high Symbian, Nokia Symbian platform and no momentum in the best of times AppStore launch such a business model similar to it. Therefore, since the advent of iPhone, a lot of developers interested in mobile developers, Nokia and the Symbian platform started to give up.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Now, no matter the platform for mobile application from the quantity, quality, and the developer\'s revenue, we can say that Apple iPhone is the mobile application market really began to boom.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Of course no doubt that Apple is indeed very close in some ways. But I do not think it is bad children.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Picture of the future of the software industry should not only open source software, only commercial software, or software only under the AppStore. Three different modes, each other to form a very good supplement.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">In the iPhone / iPod touch, and specific areas such iPad, AppStore model is incredibly powerful. Apple earnings to see you will know how much this opens up a third-party software market. The concept of smart phones appeared almost 10 years, has never been a platform, bringing together so many third-party developers, so many excellent free and paid applications. Previously, third-party developers are making money of course, but the scale and form together in such a platform is unprecedented.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Assuming iPhone OS platform, all the same, just remove the AppStore, we will find that many are now third-party developers to get rich, they just only in the dreams of fortune. Therefore, a certain degree of closure is not necessarily a root of all evil.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">It is because when the issue in the application of the strict need Apple Developer Certificate signed by the greatest extent in the prevention of piracy, making sales of a variety of payment applications have been guaranteed. It is also because of criticism by many people can even say that is too strict quality audits to ensure only the procedures within the AppStore has a certain quality level, which would allow consumers to enjoy in the AppStore in to look and buy more procedures.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">What\'s more, Apple\'s next picture, the only piece of gorgeous, not all. Open source / commercial / AppStore three modes, I think that their own strength in the future, will have their place.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">I have repeatedly stressed that, like open people, the mentality is more to open. Some people do not want to allow the open source world, do not want to open, this is an open mind. You love CopyLeft, you could have your code open sourced. But CopyLeft not include forcing others to the spirit of open source (subject to licensing restrictions would result in a different matter.)</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">I also agree with the spirit of open source, open source projects themselves, are being maintained, but do these open source projects, and I made such a relatively closed iPhone platform for the above items, did not create any conflict.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">I would like to see in the next open source / commercial / AppStore three models, fancy, are booming. In fact, the rise of open source, and not kill the business, but expanded our vision of the entire software industry and territory. App Store also has a similar role, I look forward to it gives me more to come.</span></span> </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>'),(162,'linux','en','/a/IT/2010/0917/718.html','Large adjustments or will abandon Novell SUSE Linux, V','2010-09-17','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">According to The Wall Street Journal reported that several sources said, Novell is working with VMware, including at least two potential buyers, including negotiations to sell its business. <br /> The source said, VMware wants to acquire Novell\'s SUSE <u><a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/os/linux/\"><span class=\"t_tag\" href=\"tag.php?name=Linux\" onclick=\"tagshow(event)\">Linux</span></a></u> operating <span class=\"t_tag\" href=\"tag.php?name=%CF%B5%CD%B3\" onclick=\"tagshow(event)\">system</span> business, the acquisition of <span class=\"t_tag\" href=\"tag.php?name=%C8%ED%BC%FE\" onclick=\"tagshow(event)\">software</span> company Attachmate may include NetWare <span class=\"t_tag\" href=\"tag.php?name=%CD%F8%C2%E7\" onclick=\"tagshow(event)\">network</span> operating systems, including Novell SUSE Linux part of the assets other than or in addition to other assets. <br /><br /> It is reported that, although there are differences between the two sides in the price, but Novell is likely to Linux business to VMware.

time interval specified number of statistics. The default is 1. <br /> For example: <br /> vmstat 3 <br /> Updated once every 3 seconds, said output information, cycle output, press ctrl + c to stop output. <br /> vmstat 3 5 <br /> Updated once every 3 seconds, said output information, statistics, stop after 5 times the output. <br /> <strong>2. iostat command <br /></strong> iostat is the I / O statistics (input / output statistics) stands, the main function is the system disk I / O operations to be monitored. The output shows the disk read and write the main statistical information, but also gives the CPU usage. As with vmstat, iostat can not be in-depth analysis of a process, only the overall system were analyzed. <br /> iostat generally not with the system installed, to use the iostat tool, you need to install a Sysstat system toolkit, Sysstat is an open source software, the official address is <a href=\"http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sebastien.godard\">http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sebastien.godard</a> <br /> Can select the source code package or rpm packages install, here is not about the installation process, the installation is complete, the system will be more three command: iostat, sar and mpstat. You can then run directly in the system iostat command. <br /> iostat syntax is as follows: <br /> iostat [-c |-d] [-k] [-t] [-x [device]] [interval [count]] <br /> The meaning of the various options and parameters are as follows: <br /> -C: show CPU usage. <br /> -D: shows disk usage. <br /> -K: the k bytes per second, units of display data. <br /> -T: print statistics begin time. <br /> -X device: Specify the name of the disk device to statistics, the default for all disk devices. <br /> interval: specifies the time interval between the two statistics; <br /> count: in accordance with the &quot;interval&quot; interval specified number of statistics. <br /> <strong>3. sar command</strong> <br /> sar command is very powerful, is an important tool for analysis of system performance, through the sar command, you can fully access the system CPU, the run queue, disk I / O, paging (swap), memory, CPU interrupts, network performance data. <br /> sar uses the format: <br /> sar [options] [g1] [-o filename] [interval [count]] <br /> The meaning of the various options and parameters are as follows: <br /> l options for the command-line options, sar command options are many, listing only commonly used options below: <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-A: Display System devices all the resources (CPU, memory, disk) operating conditions. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-u: display system at the sampling time for all CPU load status. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-P: Display the current system CPU usage is specified. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-d: Show all hard disk drives in the system sampling time conditions of use. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-r: Displays the system memory at the sampling time of usage. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-b: display buffer in the use of sampling time. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-v: show process, file, I state the nodes and the lock table. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-n: display the network running. Parameters can be followed with the DEV, EDEV, SOCK, and FULL. DEV display network interface information, EDEV shows network error statistics, SOCK display socket information, FULL three all of the information displayed. They can be used separately or together. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-q: shows the size of the run queue, the average time it loads the same system. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-R: Display process activities within the sampling time. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-y: the display terminal device activities within the sampling time. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-w: display system exchange activities in the state of the sampling period. <br /> l-o filename: the results of said commands in binary format will be stored in the file, filename is the file name. <br /> l interval: the sampling interval, must be some parameters. <br /> l count: that the sampling frequency, is an optional parameter, the default value is 1. <br /> For example: <br /> To view the system\'s overall CPU load conditions, once every 3 seconds and Statistics, statistics 5 times, you can use the following combinations: <br /> sar-u 3 5 <br /> System CPU count is 0, and if you want to view the operation of the second-CPU load, use the following combinations: <br /> sar-P 1 3 5 <br /> To view the system disk read and write performance, use the following combinations: <br /> sar-d 3 5 <br /> Similarly, view the system memory usage, network operation status, you can use the following commands respectively: <br /> sar-r 5 2 <br /> sar-n DEV 5 3</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><br /> <strong>15.2.3 System Performance Standards</strong></span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><br /> The main purpose of tuning the system to effectively use various resources, most of it between the application and system performance integration, the application of efficient and stable operation.

Well, this article will discuss some of these questions can be answered AIX commands, and tells you how to look for other answers. <br /> Introduction </p><p> As you know, AIX Ã‚Â® has a myriad of commands that allow you to perform a large number of tasks. Depending on the tasks you need, you may use only to a subset of these commands. These sub-sets with different users and different needs vary. However, there are some you usually want to use the core command. You need these commands to answer your own questions, or ask for the support staff to provide answers. </p><p> In this article, I will discuss some of these core commands. The purpose can be used to provide you with a convenient reference list. Although the behavior of these commands on all AIX versions should be the same, but only under the AIX 5.3 are tested. </p><p> Note: <br /> Bootinfo discussed in the following paragraphs is not user-level commands, and AIX 4.2 or later is not supported. <br /></p><p> Command ------------------------------------------------- ---------------- </p><p> <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">Kernel command</span></strong> </p><p> How do I know running a 32 bit kernel or a 64-bit kernel? </p><p> Enabled to display the kernel is 32 bit or 64-bit, enter the following command: </p><p> bootinfo-K </p><p><br /> How do I know running a single processor or multiple processor cores? </p><p> / Unix is a pointer to the kernel of the symbolic link is activated. To find out what kernel mode is running, enter ls-l / unix and view the / unix link to any file. Here is ls-l / unix command and its corresponding three possible output of the kernel: </p><p> / Unix -&gt; / usr / lib / boot / unix_up # 32 bit uniprocessor kernel <br /> / Unix -&gt; / usr / lib / boot / unix_mp # 32 bit multiprocessor kernel <br /> / Unix -&gt; / usr/lib/boot/unix_64 # 64 bit multiprocessor kernel <br /></p><p> Note: <br /> AIX 5L Version 5.3 does not support single-processor core. </p><p> How to change from one kernel mode to another kernel mode? </p><p> During the installation process will enable a default for the AIX version and the operation of the hardware kernel. Let us use the method in the previous question and assume 32-bit kernel is enabled. We also assume that you want 64-bit kernel mode. This can be done in order to achieve the following command: </p><p> ln-sf / usr/lib/boot/unix_64 / unix <br /> ln-sf / usr/lib/boot/unix_64 / usr / lib / boot / unix </p><p> bosboot-ad / dev / hdiskxx <br /> shutdown-r <br /><br /> / Dev / hdiskxx directory is to start the logical volume / dev/hd5 location. To find out hdiskxx in which xx, run the following command: </p><p> lslv-m hd5 <br /><br /> Note: <br /> In AIX 5.2, the default installation of a 32-bit kernel.

Red Hat Linux <br /> Redhat Red Hat Linux is the first release of the personal version of linux, the 1.0 version on November 3, 1994 issue. Although its history is less than other linux releases a long, but compared to a lot of Linux distributions, Red Hat\'s long history and much more. Since Red Hat 9. 0 after release, RedHat is no longer developing the company\'s Linux desktop distributions, Red Hat Linux to stop the development, and will be fully concentrate on the development of the server version, which is Red Hat Enterprise Linux version. April 30, 2004, Red Hat the company official to stop Red Hat 9. 0 version of the support, marking the official end of the Red Hat Linux. The original Red Hat Linux desktop distributions are Fedora open source community and from the plan to merge into Fedora Core release. <br /> Red Hat is currently divided into two series: the Red Hat provides technical support and updated charging Red Hat Enterprise Linux, as well as community development free from the Fedora Core. <br /></p><p> 2. Fedora Core <br /> Fedora Core (abbreviated as FC) is targeting Red Hat\'s experimental site for the new technology, many new technologies will be tested in the FC, if stable, then Red Hat will consider joining the Red Hat Enterprise Linux. <br /> Fedora Core 1 was released in late 2003, and FC is the positioning of desktop users. FC provides the latest package, while its version of the update cycle is very short, only 6 months. Since version update frequently, performance and stability can not be guaranteed, therefore, generally not recommended on the server Fedora Core. <br /> In fact, so to that, Fedora is Red Hat released Red Hat Enterprise linux version of an experiment, take the user to do the test for Red Hat Enterprise Edition released as a foundation. <br /></p><p> 3. Red Hat Enterprise Linux <br /> Red Hat Enterprise Linux (abbreviated to RHEL, Red Hat Enterprise Edition.) Red Hat is now the main job of the server version of linux development, in the version of emphasis on the performance and stability as well as hardware support. Enterprise Edition operating system, because the development cycle is longer, pay attention to performance, stability, and server software support, version updates are relatively slow. <br /> RedHat Enterprise Linux version is divided into 4 Advanced Server (AS), ES Workstation (WS), Desktop, their difference is not large, only a function of the difference. <br /></p><p> 4. Centos <br /> CentOS full name of the &quot;Community Enterprise Operating System&quot; (Community Enterprise Operating System) <br /> CentOS background: <br /> Redhat released Redhat 9. 0, no longer develop redhat 10,11 ... ..., a comprehensive shift Redhat enterprise linux (abbreviated as rhel) development, and different from the past, the new redhat Enterprise Edition requires users to first purchase lisence, redhat same time commitment to ensure the stability, security. rhel binary code is no longer available for download, but as part of redhat service, but the source code remains open. In this case, there has been centos, whitebox, dao, and so a number of open source in the enterprise version, which centos most active. <br /></p><p> Here is how to make about centos generated: </p><p><br /> Redhat CentOS community to the site download all the source code, recompile. As AS / ES / WS is a commercial product, therefore, must be all the Redhat\'s Logo CentOS and logo into their own identity. Such as the AS4. 0 SRPM original source compiled and put on Centos community logo, so that became the CentOS 4. 0. Redhat Enterprise Linux AS4 Update1 the source compiled to become a CentOS4. 1. AS4 Update2 source code compiled to become a CentOS4. 2 and so on. CentOS is produced. <br /> Therefore, it can be said of CentOS is Redhat AS / ES / WS free version can be obtained using the centos redhat enterprise linux with the same features and performance. Centos while also providing free long-term upgrade and update services. Thus, in many versions of RHEL clone, CentOS is a very outstanding very good. <br /> Although it is a RHEL clone centos, but not exactly the same, said cloning is a 100% interchangeability. In fact, different for centos, RHEL on CentOS software can not guarantee 100% above normal. <br /> To understand the difference between Redhat version series, after all. In fact, we found Why Redhat linux as a beginner to learn the reason. <br /> First of all: in the country, and even the world\'s Linux users are most familiar with, the most heard details of the distribution can be sure it is a Red Hat. Red Hat is the linux community as the &quot;boss&quot;, the U.S. company Red Hat released Red Hat linux is a commercial operation of the most successful Linux distributions, so Red Hat linux issued by a trusted company, Red Hat linux functionality and performance There is no doubt. <br /> Second: Red hat now has a huge network of user groups, network resources, the basic 90% of linux are based on Redhat linux, if you encounter any problems in the learning process, whatever the search network, there are thousands of answers to display in front of you. <br /> III: Red Hat linux version of complementary series, complement each other: If your first contact with linux, it is recommended that you install Fedora Core, Fedora Core installation is simple, good hardware support, the interface is also very beautiful, but also can experience the Redhat linux the latest features; if you have some knowledge of linux, need further study, I suggest you use the CENTOS system; if you are doing linux enterprise applications, we recommend you use RHEL version. <br /> Last: redhat wide range of applications, with typical and representative, many systems (such as red redflag, winning linux, oracle release of Enterprise Linux) are based on Red Hat linux as the base, and therefore can be said to learn the Red Hat linux, will be able to comprehend by analogy, other similar linux system can quickly mastered; around now in general are also learning to linux redhat linux based, so to facilitate communication, learning problems, more easily solved. Redhat linux while installing and using the most simple, therefore, is basically not in the &quot;loading system&quot; to waste too much time. <br /></p><p> 1.1.2 Enterprise Application preferred-suse linux <br /> The pursuit of enterprise-class applications is reliability and stability, which requires the application of building enterprise-class platform with high reliability and high stability. Enterprise linux distributions is to solve this problem. <br /> SUSE Linux is Germany\'s most famous release, around the world also enjoys a high reputation. November 4, 2003, Novell announced the company will acquire SuSE. January 2004 completion of the acquisition process, Novell SuSE also will be officially named SuSE Linux. Novell\'s acquisition of suse, speed up the development of the suse linux, suse linux server, both in the desktop market or markets are more specialized, according to incomplete statistics, suse linux linux market share in Europe is now nearly 80% of the share, most of the critical applications is built under suse linux. Suse shorter due to China, while with suse marketing model in China, the domestic short-term can not be accepted, so now suse market share in China is not great, but this does not affect the suse linux high reliability and stability the fact that, with the development of suse, suse linux in China believe that the application will be more and more. <br /></p><p> 1.1.3 Preferred-Ubuntu Linux Game <br /> Speaking of linux desktop market, Ubuntu Linux account for almost half of the desktop linux, Ubuntu Linux main linux desktop, the most beautiful interface, simple yet gorgeous, if you want entertainment under linux, Ubuntu Linux is definitely the first choice. <br /> Ubuntu is very user-friendly installation, simply follow the instructions step by step, the installation is as easy as with Windows! And, Ubuntu is best known for the most comprehensive hardware support for Linux distributions, and many other distributions can not be used or not used in the default configuration of hardware, in Ubuntu, can be easy to get. So you can install windows as easily as the installation of Ubuntu. Enjoy the fun of Ubuntu linux. </p><p><br /> 1.1.4 linux as a server is the trend </p><p><br /> In the above section introduces some of the most common linux distributions, in fact, there are many linux distributions much more common there is Debian GNU / Linux, Mandriva, Gentoo, Slackware, Knoppix, MEPIS, Xandros, domestic red flag redflag, winning linux, etc., and is not introduced one by one, in fact, look at the various linux distributions, linux release is nothing more than moving from two aspects, one is the server market, but the desktop market. <br /> As the representative of the Ubuntu Linux distribution linux desktop market is taking the route, although they bring a lot of surprises to the user, update soon, but because of the desktop market has such a strong opponent windows, linux desktop'),(174,'linux','en','/a/web/nginx/2010/0630/261.html','apache alias in the realization of the nginx','2010-06-30','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> In my environment, set documentRoot directory: <br /> root / data0/htdocs/NetBeansProjects/_example/passport; <br /> Php file set forwarded to fastcgi: <br /> location ~ .* \\.

Linus\'s answer is no; He said he wrote the original Linux only as a short-term projects, and ready to use better the to be replaced. GNU project because it was also very good and BSD camp, he believes there will be other people to make more powerful and more professional to the core. At the same time, when he was just a little Linux as their love only. Zheshi witty Andrew added: &quot;However, final proof, no one do than Linux better. I, as one kernel newbie (modest argument, in fact in the field Andrew least 10 years), though not be term vision, but I personally think that Linux is indeed very alarming development. &quot;</span></span> </p><p> <strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Question 2: How do you cope with the rapid development of the kernel?</span></span></strong> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Jim then asked, How do you cope with the rapid development of the kernel? Andrew said, as the core of continuous improvement, the number of developers who continue to expand. The development of core responsibilities assigned to each person then, and now I just take the Linux Linus total project only a small part of the work. Quality assurance in the code the dealer has played a big role. Based on this, Andrew said that just now the kernel community to provide technical, but the dealers can get the kernel from the community, and then into actual products.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Linus on the Linux kernel that in general people are not interested in things. For example, he said he always felt that <span class=\"nounderline\">the server</span> market is a boring place, but was successfully applied to shift the Linux <span class=\"nounderline\">servers.</span> This is also one of the main advantages of Linux, Linus pointed out that no company would be interested in all uses of Linux, but their effect is often used for Linux, that he was amazed. He expressed some areas of Linux applications and even he did not expect. This also means that no one needs to use the Linux kernel users of the product while maintaining full responsibility for the negative. In particular, Linus, the real need is to care for myself, to ensure that all of the code fragment into together. After all, the power of a single kernel is limited, can not satisfy all application requirements, it can do is to constantly improve the core, allowed to meet the wider environment.</span></span> </p><p> <strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Question 3: Is it wise to continue to use the single-core? Single core can be applied to multi-task environment? Handle fragmentation, when this particular task is not to temporarily give up multi-core features?</span></span></strong> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">From this interview, Jim asked to split the kernel, as well as Linux continues to use the wisdom of a single core, while the single core is suitable for multi-tasking environment; future to support the development needs of different areas will separate out the different versions of the core issues .</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Linus that the single-core to work well, he is also very annoying to see Linux division. Present problems in many areas there is a commonality in fact, for example, when the field of Linux used in <span class=\"nounderline\">mobile phones,</span> then the system for <span class=\"nounderline\">power</span> management requires more points, but proved to <span class=\"nounderline\">servers, power</span> management is also very important. In general, users in different application areas of concern in fact the same thing, only concerned the timing is different. Only high-end <span class=\"nounderline\">server</span> applications, such as who will be concerned in the symmetric multiprocessing, and now is basically to buy a desktop computer does not support SMP, right, and now SMP is also used in <span class=\"nounderline\">mobile phones</span> in the. This is the single-core approach has the advantage: If the <span class=\"nounderline\">phone</span> user needs SMP support, Linux always waiting for you.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Andrew said that Linux is widely used mainly due to the unique technical properties of the kernel. Linux kernel is now very easy to work together. The current Linux kernel has been the efforts of everyone from the original &quot;small&quot; devices become more and more. Unfortunately, there are still many small embedded systems in the community is still not very good technical support, but the Linux community as a whole is very concerned about this part of the body, embedded in the future we will also give good technical support groups .</span></span> </p><p> <strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Question 4: Where is the kernel development workers, mainly from Brazil to the kernel developers to participate in the development come from?</span></span></strong> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Linus responded that, Linux kernel developers are mainly from North America, Europe and Australia. Because of cultural and language differences, increasing the difficulty of the entire community management. Linus said to run a global project, first of all need to solve the problem of language commonality, Linus is also fun to say: &quot;Unfortunately, instead of using the Finnish community (Linus is Finnish).&quot; Linus said that the world has a lot of good developers, But at the same time difficult to find good developers who are good at English. In order to solve regional and language and cultural differences, Linus said that they usually work is to establish a local community, and then connect these communities as a bridge to other communities and headquarters.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Andrew pointed out that obviously many people in Japan in recent years to participate in kernel development to; he recorded a lot of efforts on the Linux Foundation, the community members. He also found that people use Email for communication between non-native is helpful; because both sides have enough time to understand each other\'s meaning. As to where to start communication, Andrew opinion is to choose an interesting and challenging work begins.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Linus that open source software is programmed to understand the world situation in a good way. Unlike the class open source projects, the project requires an active exchange with the people together to solve the problem. Some companies in need of technical personnel, often in the open source community to find those activists. Therefore, to participate in open source projects, but also to the world a good way to promote their own. Finally, Linus said that it is difficult to find good programmers, they generally get good pay, they often work for open source software. Andrew also agreed with the firm belief that programmers are widely available light. The time at Google, Andrew often issued to him by a number of internal staff qualifications, to hire whom he chooses. He made the first move was to open the git log to see who has done what in the community activities.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Linus said that although the kernel may not be a good starting point to learn the best programmers. However, there are many kernel developers, people often think that the kernel is very mysterious, and even have a fear of psychological approach. The initial development of small projects for those who are a good starting environment.</span></span> </p><p> <strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Question 5: Will never work for Linux?</span></span></strong> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Linus replied, &quot;Never is a very long time,&quot; he initially only to the kernel as a two-month project, but he said they would continue to do the kernel, because now he felt fun.

Thus, when a node fails, another node in the cluster automatically take over the failed node\'s resources to ensure service lasting, uninterrupted operation. Thus the transfer function of the cluster with automatic fault. <br /> A cluster must have a shared data storage, because the services provided outside the cluster is the same, any one cluster node to run an application, the application of the data are centrally stored in the node shared space, each node of the operating system only running application services, application files stored. <br /> In summary, to build a cluster system requires at least two servers, but also need to have the serial line, cluster software, shared storage devices (such as disk arrays) and so on. <br /> Based <a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/os/linux/\"><u>Linux</u></a> cluster with its very high computing power, scalability, availability and more cost-effective optimization of a variety of applications in the enterprise to stand out. Become a concern for all <a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/os/linux/\"><u>Linux</u></a> applications hot, master knowledge of Linux clusters, low price can be used to make high-performance applications. To enterprises and individuals to save costs. Large domestic Sina, Netease, adopted high-performance linux cluster building web applications, using the famous search engine google linux servers on a million, a large cluster, the cluster of these instances shows the status of the application in linux and important sex. <br /> <strong>2 Characteristics and function of the cluster</strong> <br /> 2.1 High availability and scalability <br /> 1. High availability for some very strong real-time applications, must ensure that the service runs 24 hours a day, and as software, hardware, network, human and other reasons, a single service operating environment difficult to meet this requirement at this time build a cluster system is a good choice to build one of the greatest advantages of the cluster with high availability cluster, the service fails, the cluster system can automatically switch the service from the failed node to another backup node, to provide uninterrupted service, ensure the continued operation of the business. <br /> 2. Scalability with the increasing volume of business, the existing entity can not meet the needs of the cluster service, you can dynamically to the cluster, add one or more service nodes, to meet application needs, and enhance the overall performance of the cluster. This is the scalability of the cluster. <br /> 2.2 load balancing and error recovery <br /> 1. Load balancing cluster system is characterized by the greatest flexibility, and effective sharing of system load, defined by the cluster load sharing their own strategies, allocation of the client\'s access to the following each service node, for example, you can define polling allocation strategy, the average request allocation to each service node, you can also define the minimum load allocation strategy, when a request comes in, determine which service node cluster system are relatively free to distribute this request to this node. <br /> 2. Error recovery when a node in a task not yet complete, for some reason fails, time, and then another service node should be able to accomplish this task, which is the cluster to provide error recovery, through error redirection to ensure that each mission can be effectively completed. <br /> 2.3 IP heartbeat detection and drift <br /> One. Heart rate monitoring in order to achieve load balancing, providing high availability services and the implementation of error recovery, the cluster system provides the heartbeat monitoring, heart rate monitoring is achieved through the heartbeat, the heartbeat of the equipment can do a RS 232 serial line can also be used independently heartbeat to run a piece of card can also be a shared disk arrays, the number of heartbeat cluster nodes should be decreased by 1, note that if the heartbeat through the card to do so, each node has two network cards, of which a private network as the machine is connected directly to each other the appropriate card, to monitor each heartbeat. Also a connection to the outside public network to provide services, while heart rate card and IP card services, as not in a subnet address. Direct impact on the efficiency of the heart rate monitor the duration of failover, the cluster system is maintained through the heart technology and effective communication between nodes inside. <br /> 2. IP address of the cluster shift, in addition to each service node itself the real IP address, IP address there is a drift, drift IP Why is it, because the IP addresses are not fixed, for example, double the two nodes hot standby, the normal state, the drift of IP in the master node, when the primary node fails, the drift IP address automatically switches to the standby node, therefore, in order to ensure uninterrupted service in the cluster system, external provision of services IP must be to the drift IP address, although the IP node itself can also offer services, but when the node failure, the service switched to another node, but the service failed node IP is still IP address, this time, the service with the interrupt.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><strong>Category 3 Cluster <br /></strong> 3.1 High Availability Cluster <br /> 1. The concept of high availability in English stands for High Availability Cluster High Availability Cluster, referred to as HA Cluster, the maximum availability of the means available, from the name of the cluster can be seen, the function of these Clusters is to protect the user\'s application program lasting, uninterrupted service. <br /> When an application fails, or the system hardware, network failure, the application can automatically, quickly switching from one node to another node, thus ensuring the application of sustained, uninterrupted service outside, which is to achieve high-availability clustering functions <br /> 2. Common HA Cluster <br /> We often say that the hot standby, dual-prepared, multi-machine equipment and so on are each other\'s areas of high availability clusters, these clusters typically have two or more nodes. A typical hot standby structure shown in Figure 1:</span></span> </p><div style=\"text-align: center\"> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"182\" onclick=\"window.open(\'/uploads/allimg/100920/1_100920093219_1.png\')\" src=\"http://www.ixdba.net/uploads/allimg/100920/1_100920093219_1.png\" style=\"cursor: pointer\" width=\"384\" /><br /><br /> Figure 1 Structure of Hot Standby</span></span> </div><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Hot Standby mode is the simplest application, that is often said that the active / standby mode, it uses two servers, one as the master server (action), run the application outside service, the other as a standby machine (standby ), installation and application as the main server, but did not start the service, is in the standby state. Between the host and prepare machine technology with each other through the heartbeat monitoring, monitoring of the resources can be network, operating system, and also the service, the user can according to your needs, choose the resources need to be monitored, when monitoring and controlling equipment to host a resource failure, based on pre-configured strategy, first to switch over IP and application services will have to take over over and went on to provide services outside You prepare machines due to switching process time is very end user procedures do feel out issues, but also for the switching, in order to protect the application lasting, uninterrupted service. <br /> Dual Active in hot standby, based on two independent applications to run simultaneously on two machines, Internet-based equipment, which is prepared by two servers both host machine, when any one application fails, another server in a short time can be taken over the application of machine malfunction, in order to protect the service continued, uninterrupted operation. Dual Active advantage is saving equipment resources, the two hot standby application requires at least four servers, and Dual Active only two to complete high-availability server clustering capabilities, but also have Dual Active the shortcomings of its own: in a node failover, another node to run the two applications to the service, there may be the case load is too large. <br /> Preparation of multi-machine interaction is a hot standby of the technology upgrade, through a cluster composed of multiple machines can be set up between multiple machines over a flexible strategy, for example, a server cluster environment composed of 8, 3 runs web applications, 3 applications to run mail, therefore, the remaining one can be as prepared 3 sets of web server machines, 3 sets another mail server as a reserve unit, through such arrangements, adequate and reasonable use of the server resources, but also to ensure the system\'s high availability. <br /> To note are: high-availability cluster can not guarantee the security of application data, it is only lasting solution is to provide uninterrupted service of external, to the software, hardware, networking, human factors failures reduce the impact of the application to the lowest level. <br /> 3. High Availability Cluster high-availability cluster software is generally achieved through the high-availability software, commonly used in high availability under linux software: open source heartbea HA, Redhat provides RHCS, business software ROSE, keepalived and so on. In the following sections we will detail heartbea HA configuration and use. <br /> 3.2 Load Balancing Load balancing system, the English full name Load Balance Cluster, referred to as LB Cluster, the load balancing cluster also has two or more than two servers, divided into front end and back-end node services load scheduling of two parts, the load scheduling partially responsible for the client\'s request in accordance with the policies assigned to different back-end service node, and back-end nodes is the real part of providing application services. <br /> The difference is that with HA Cluster in the load balancing cluster, all the back-end nodes are active, they offer services, work load sharing system. <br /> Load balancing cluster can be applied to a high load across multiple nodes to jointly complete for the busy business, access to a large load applications, but it also has deficiencies: When a node fails, the front-end dispatch system does not that this node can no longer provide services, will continue to dispatch client requests to the failed node up, so that access will fail, in order to solve this problem, the load scheduling system into a node generally monitoring system. <br /> Node is located in front of the load dispatch control system aircraft, responsible for monitoring the following service node, when a node fails, the node monitoring system</span></span>'),(180,'linux','en','/a/os/linux/2010/0719/327.html','Red Hat Linux6 Beta 2 new tests to look forward to!

Red Hat will run on Itanium server &quot;Enterprise Linux 5&quot; to add new features and product life cycle in accordance with its standard policy of support for new hardware. </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>'),(184,'linux','en','/a/IT/2010/0422/53.html','Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 beta today released Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 beta','2010-04-22','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><div style=\"text-align: center\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"180\" onclick=\"window.open(\'/uploads/allimg/100422/1_100422143041_1.png\')\" src=\"http://www.ixdba.net/uploads/allimg/100422/1_100422143041_1_lit.png\" style=\"cursor: pointer\" width=\"555\" /><br /><br /> <span>Red Hat has just released Enterprise Linux RHEL 6.0 in the Beta version, the version of the most noteworthy improvements include:</span> </div><ul><li> <span>Comprehensive power management features</span> </li><li> <span>Performance</span> </li><li> <span>Enhanced Scalability</span> </li><li> <span>The new security features</span> </li><li> <span>Virtualization</span> </li><li> <span>Storage improvements, support the FCoE and iSCSI support network block device</span> </li><li> <span>EXT4 file system support</span> </li><li> <span>Reliability, availability, and applicability</span> </li><li> <span>Enhanced Compilation Tools - GCC 4.4</span> </li><li> <span>Improved desktop, support for multiple virtual desktops</span> </li></ul><p> The following address to download the Beta version: </p><p> <a href=\"http://www.redhat.com/rhel/beta/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.redhat.com/rhel/beta/</a> </p><p> <a href=\"http://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/rhel/beta/6/i386/iso/RHEL6.0-20100414.0-AP-i386-DVD1.iso\">RHEL6.0-AP-i386-DVD1.iso</a> (3,650 MB, <a href=\"http://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/rhel/beta/6/i386/iso/SHA256SUM\">SHA256</a> ) <br /> <a href=\"http://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/rhel/beta/6/x86_64/iso/RHEL6.0-AP-x86_64-DVD1.iso\">RHEL6.0-20,100,414.0-AP-x86_64-DVD1.iso</a> (4,105 MB, <a href=\"http://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/rhel/beta/6/x86_64/iso/SHA256SUM\">SHA256</a> ). </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>'),(185,'linux','en','/a/os/Solris/2010/0422/31.html','inode linux file system linux file system related concepts of the relevant concepts in the inode','2010-04-22','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> <strong>One. inode size defined</strong> &lt;br /&gt; unit: Byte <br /></p><div style=\"text-align: center\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"314\" onclick=\"window.open(\'/uploads/allimg/100422/1_100422112131_1.gif\')\" src=\"http://www.ixdba.net/uploads/allimg/100422/1_100422112131_1.gif\" style=\"cursor: pointer\" width=\"438\" /><br /></div><p></p><p> inode table is the data area of the index table. </p><p> Inode inode into memory and file <u><a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/os/\">system</a></u> in the inode, we have said here is the file <u><a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/os/\">system</a></u> in the inode. </p><p> <strong>1.</strong> Linux FS inode table can be simply divided into two parts with the data area. inode table has many of the inode, inode were recorded for each attribute of a file distributed with this file which datablock on (that is, we say that the pointer.) <br /> inode two functions: the log file attributes and pointers </p><p> <strong>2.</strong> Inode table in the red area that inode size, is 128Byte, in liunx system through the command we can see, the system is so defined. <br /> Inode size is assigned to an inode to record the document properties of the disk block size. </p><pre> <code>dumpe2fs -h /dev/hda6 | grep node <br /> Inode size:128</code>\r\n<code>dumpe2fs -h /dev/hda6 | grep node <br /> Inode size:128</code> </pre><p> <strong>3.</strong> Data ares in the purple zone block size, is our general concept of disk blocks.

Because business is run on operating systems, so the operating system backup and recovery efficiency is directly related to the recovery of the entire business system level. So back up the operating system becomes critical. <br /> <strong>Second, the data need to back up Linux systems</strong> &lt;br /&gt; ghost in the software under windows, you can complete the entire system to another hard drive, ghost is a disk mirroring technology, all data can be mirrored system disk to another hard disk backup When the system problems, the backup mirror disk system in a short time all the data can be fully restored. <br /> Linux, although there are tools like ghost, but because of hardware compatibility, such as the complexity of recovery, ghost and can not be good for Linux image backup, and if the Linux system partition is too large, backup and recovery process will be very long, the ghost is not suitable for backup Linux operating system. <br /> In fact, the overall backup system is not a good strategy, Linux operating system does not need to fully back up, we just need to back up all configuration files to the system, so the backup process is quick, recovery is also fast. <br /> Linux system files to be backed up can be divided into two categories: system-level configuration files and user-level configuration file. <br /> System-level configuration file of some major global configuration of the system information, such as / etc / directory, / home directory, / boot directory, / root directory and so on. These directories on the system operation is critical, and apply the settings for different systems are different, if these files are missing, even though the new operating system installed quickly, but also to reconfigure the system to spend more time long. <br /> User-level configuration file is the user\'s business application and system related configuration files that are essential for business applications to run the system, once lost, the system will be unable to start the business, such as / usr / local the entire directory, / var / www directory, / etc throughout the catalog. <br /> Important documents that must be backed up, then the backup directory which does not require it, such as / dev directory, / proc directory, / mnt directory, / tmp directories, etc. These directories are not backed up, because either of these directories of memory data, or a temporary file, no important data, backing up the principle that we must all back up important data, useless data not backed up. <br /> <strong>Three backup media and methods</strong> &lt;br /&gt; to back up data, we must have the security of data containers stored on the storage media Jiben requirements generally from the access speed storage security, storage capacity of three aspects into account. <br /> Access speed is a basic requirement of the storage medium, data backup is a process of read and write operations is extremely frequent, very high speed access to backup media, backup data can greatly shorten the time, but can also reduce the time to recover data . <br /> Storage security is a mandatory requirement storage medium, such as the unsafe storage devices do not store the media, that many storage devices do a lot of security, optimization, such as doing raid disk array, cache reading and writing. Professional storage vendors are EMC, IBM, SUN, etc., have their own storage devices. <br /> Select the storage medium storage capacity is also an aspect to be considered, too much storage space will cause the waste of storage devices, storage space is too small, resulting in data storage failure, therefore, must be based on the size of backup data, select the appropriate size of storage media. <br /> 1. Commonly used backup media are optical storage media, disk, tape drives, floppy disks, etc., where the focus on what the tape drive to use: <br /> Tape drives under Linux using a variety of ways, tar command is the most frequently used method, tar is mainly used for stand-alone environment, the data is written directly to tape. Tape drive in the Linux device name corresponds to / dev / stX, if the first tape drive, that is, / dev/st0, the basic operation is as follows: <br /> (1) rewind, volume to the starting position of the tape mt-f / dev/st0 rewind <br /> (2) erase the contents of the tape mt-f / dev/st0 erase <br /> Newly purchased tape, opened to use, without the need for erase operations, while the tape when the data filled, the tape can cover the original data and continue to write, so without any erase operation, the erase of the tape has some damage, it is recommended not to perform erase operation. <br /> (3) the band is about to roll to the initial position of the tape from the tape machine and then eject mt-f / dev/st0 offline <br /> (4) are listed by tar directory or file on the tape tar tvf / dev/st0 [need to view the file or directory] <br /> If not followed with any file or directory, is to look at all the data on the tape when the tape does not have any data, to do this would be an error, but does not affect the tape used. <br /> (5) backup data to tape via tar tar cvf / dev/st0 [to be written to the file or directory name] <br /> Backup data to tape in two ways, packing tape and do not write compressed package directly into the tape. Here we do not recommend packing the data directly into the tape method. This will increase the security of data storage. Why does not recommend the package back then, because the tape is a sequential write data, that is, the linear storage, if all the data packaged into a separate file, then when the tape failure of any one place, may lead to unzip the zip file failure not available, and if not Dabao backup data storage, then there are a lot of files on tape, even if the tape somewhere fails, the rest of the files are still available, thus greatly improving the security of data backup. <br /> For example, / data/ixdba1.tar.gz the compressed file is written to tape, and cover the original content, you can do the following: <br /> [Root @ webserver / data] # tar cvf / dev/st0 / data/ixdba1.tar.gz <br /> Through the &quot;tar cvf&quot; to write data to tape, each tape will cover any original data, that is, every time from the beginning of the tape to write the data. Transmission speed of the tape drive more slowly, for not a lot of backup files, backup can be completed in a very short period of time, very suitable for system-level file backup. <br /> (6) through the tar continues to write data to tape tar rvf / dev/st0 [to write the file name] <br /> Because tape is linear storage, data is written in turn, in order to write the new data, does not overwrite the original data that already exists, you can use &quot;tar rvf&quot; parameters in order to write data to tape. <br /> For example, in order to / data/ixdba2.tar.gz and / data/ixdba3.tar.gz backup to tape drive: <br /> [Root @ webserver / data] # tar rvf / dev/st0 / data/ixdba2.tar.gz <br /> [Root @ webserver / data] # tar rvf / dev/st0 / data/ixdba3.tar.gz <br /> (7) through the tar to restore data from tape to disk tar xvf / dev/st0 [to restore the file or directory name] <br /> For example, first there is access to all data on the tape: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # tar tvf / dev/st0 <br /> -Rw-r - r - root / root 320 2009-2-20 10:19:02 ixdba1.tar.gz <br /> -Rw-r - r - root / root 320 2009-2-20 10:25:10 ixdba2.tar.gz <br /> -Rw-r - r - root / root 320 2009-2-20 10:45:18 ixdba3.tar.gz <br /> Now if you want to restore the tape on the ixdba2.tar.gz file to disk, you can execute the following command: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # tar xvf / dev/st0 ixdba2.tar.gz <br /> ixdba2.tar.gz <br /> This will restore data from tape to the current path. <br /> 2. Data backup data backup common are local backup and remote disaster recovery, according to the requirements of the importance of the extent of the data, choose the right backup. <br /> Local backup is to back up data to local system disk, tape or proprietary storage devices, local backup is a level of data security considerations, mainly for system failure, or hacker attacks, data loss situation. <br /> Remote disaster recovery of data and services is considered a higher security indicators, mainly to back up data to another city or country, mainly for possible natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, etc., when these natural disasters , the local backup data will be lost, this time to a remote disaster recovery need to restore data. <br /> <strong>Four backup strategy formulation <br /></strong> Common backup strategy with full backup, incremental backup, while incremental backups can also be divided between the cumulative incremental backup and incremental backup, the following briefly under the differences between them. <br /> 1. Full backup full backup is to backup all data, for the Linux operating system, is to all the files under the root partition backup, full backup of the benefits are: all data is backed up, the system can recover any data loss, and recovery efficiency; disadvantage is a longer backup time, backup, a lot of useless data and wasted storage space. <br /> 2. Incremental backup data in a large business applications, the daily full backup of the system is unrealistic, requiring an incremental backup strategy. Incremental backup is only backing up or changing data each day, without backup system does not change the data, so the amount of data backed up is greatly reduced, can shorten the backup time, but incremental backups and disadvantages, that is, data recovery When more complex and requires data with the first full backup and incremental backup data recovery portfolio, and if there are multiple incremental backup files, the recovery process will become very slow. <br /> A good backup strategy is: for small data and small daily increase in the amount of data systems, recommended to choose a full backup, shorter backup and restore is very simple. The huge amount of data a day, also a lot of new data system, we must choose an incremental backup.</span></span> </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>'),(189,'linux','en','/a/os/linux/2010/0831/598.html','Original Series Linux security policy settings under the method used','2010-08-31','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">1.

Prohibition of Control-Alt-Delete key combination to reboot the system default settings in linux, press Control-Alt-Delete key, the system will automatically reboot, which is very safe, and therefore prohibited Control-Alt-Delete key combination to restart system, simply modify / etc / inittab file: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # vi / etc / inittab <br /> Find this line: ca:: ctrlaltdel: / sbin / shutdown-t3-r now <br /> In before &quot;#&quot; <br /> And: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # telinit q</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">3. Shell command to limit the size of recorded history, by default, bash shell in the file $ HOME / .bash_history commands stored in records up to 1000 (based on systems, the default number of records different). System, each user\'s home directory has one file. <br /> Command records the history of so many, certainly is not safe, it is necessary to limit the file size. <br /> You can edit / etc / profile file, modify the options are as follows: <br /> HISTSIZE = 30 <br /> Indicated in the file $ HOME / .bash_history recorded in the recent history of 30 commands. If the &quot;HISTSIZE&quot; is set to 0, then the command history does not record, then it can not use the keyboard arrow keys to find the history command. <br /> 4. Remove unnecessary system default user and group <br /> Linux offers a variety of system accounts, the system installed, if not some of the user or group, we should delete it immediately, because the account the more insecure the system becomes, the more vulnerable. <br /> Delete unnecessary user system with the following command <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # userdel username <br /> Remove unnecessary system group with the following command: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # groupdel groupname <br /> Linux system, you can delete the default user and group: <br /> Delete users, such as adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, news, uucp, operator, games, gopher, etc.. <br /> Delete the group, such as adm, lp, news, uucp, games, dip, pppusers, popusers, slipusers and so on. <br /> 5. Off selinux <br /> Security-Enhanced Linux SELinux is a short, is a mandatory access control security system kernel, the current SELinux has been integrated into the mainline Linux 2.6 kernel and most Linux distributions, as SELinux and the existing Linux applications and Linux-compatible kernel module There are still some issues of sexual, it is recommended for beginners to close selinux, until linux has in-depth understanding of, and then not later than on the selinux-depth study! <br /> View selinux is enabled linux system, you can use getenforce command: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # getenforce <br /> Disabled <br /> Off selinux, in the redhat release series, you can directly modify the following documents: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # vi / etc / sysconfig / selinux <br /> # This file controls the state of SELinux on the system. <br /> # SELINUX = can take one of these three values: <br /> # Enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced. <br /> # Permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing. <br /> # Disabled - SELinux is fully disabled. <br /> SELINUX = enforcing <br /> # SELINUXTYPE = type of policy in use. Possible values are: <br /> # Targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected. <br /> # Strict - Full SELinux protection. <br /> SELINUXTYPE = targeted <br /> Will SELINUX = enforcing modify SELINUX = disabled, reboot the system will stop after the SElinux. <br /> 6. Tcp_wrappers firewall settings <br /> Tcp_Wrappers is used to analyze the TCP / IP packet of software, similar to IP packet software still iptables, linux by default are installed with this software, as a secure system, Linux itself has two layers of firewall security, IP filtering mechanism through iptables implement the first layer of protection, iptables firewall to monitor the system through intuitive operating conditions, blocks malicious network attacks and protect the normal operation of the entire system, from attack and destruction. About iptables implementation, described in detail in the next chapters. If the passage of the first layer of protection, then the next layer of protection is tcp_wrappers, and the system can be achieved through Tcp_Wrappers some of the services provided in the opening and closing, permitted and prohibited, so as to more effectively ensure the safe operation of the system. <br /> Tcp_Wrappers the use of very simple, just two configuration files: / etc / hosts.allow and / etc / hosts.deny <br /> (1) Check whether the system is installed Tcp_Wrappers <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-q tcp_wrappers or <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-qa | grep tcp <br /> tcp_wrappers-7.6-37.2 <br /> tcpdump-3.8.2-10.RHEL4 <br /> If there is a similar output of the above, that system has been installed tcp_wrappers module. If not, may not be installed, you can find the installation disk from a linux system, the corresponding RPM package installed. <br /> (2) tcp_wrappers firewall limitations of the system can use a service tcp_wrappers firewall, depending on whether the service applied libwrapped library file, if the application can use the tcp_wrappers a firewall, the system default of some services such as: sshd, portmap, sendmail, xinetd, vsftpd, tcpd so you can use the tcp_wrappers firewall. <br /> (3) tcp_wrappers set of rules <br /> tcp_wrappers achieved through the firewall / etc / hosts.allow and / etc / hosts.deny to complete the two files, first look at the set of formats: <br /> service: host (s) [: action] <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ service: service name on behalf of, such as sshd, vsftpd, sendmail and so on. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ host (s): host name or IP address, you can have more than one, such as 192.168.60.0, www.ixdba.net <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ action: action, meet the conditions of the action taken. <br /> A few keywords: <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ ALL: all services or all of the IP. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ ALL EXCEPT: all services or all of the IP to remove specified. <br /> For example: ALL: ALL EXCEPT 192.168.60.132 <br /> In addition to 192.168.60.132 said the machine, any machine or perform all services allowed or denied. <br /> Understand the set syntax, the following can be accessed on the service limit. <br /> For example, a linux server on the Internet to achieve the goal: only allow 222.90.66.4,61.185.224.66 services and domain name softpark.com remote login via SSH to the system, set the following: <br /> First set the computer to allow log on, the configuration / etc / hosts.allow files, settings, very simple, just modify / etc / hosts.allow (If you do not have this file, please create your own) this file. <br /> Just add the following rules / etc / hosts.allow to. <br /> sshd: 222.90.66.4 61.185.224.66 softpark.com <br /> Then set the machine does not allow login, which is configured / etc / hosts.deny file. <br /> Under normal circumstances, linux will first determine the / etc / hosts.allow file, if the remote computer logon to meet the file / etc / hosts.allow set, would not have to use / etc / hosts.deny files, on the contrary, If the file does not meet the rules set hosts.allow then hosts.deny files would be to use, if hosts.deny rules, the hosts were restricted to inaccessible linux server, if does not meet the hosts.deny of setting, the host can access the linux server by default, so that when set up / etc / hosts.allow file access rules, just set the / etc / hosts.deny as a &quot;state of all the computers can not log in&quot; button. <br /> sshd: ALL <br /> Thus, a</span></span>'),(190,'linux','en','/a/os/linux/2010/0831/597.html','Original Series Use Linux, Yum','2010-08-31','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">A software upgrade to the software functionality improvements and safety upgrades, with the windows system similar to, linux operating system also needs regular updates to the software upgrade and maintain software are up to date. <u><a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/os/linux/\">Linux</a></u> operating system upgrades can be divided into automatic update and manual update in two ways: automatically upgrade is usually authorized in a linux distribution or free distribution carried out under linux, just enter the upgrade command, the system will automatically upgrade without human intervention. <br /> yum is yellowdog updater modified acronym, yellow dog (yellow dog) is a Linux release version, but Redhat is the technical advantage of this upgrade to their distribution on the formation of the current yum. automatic updates for linux yum is a tool commonly used by yum with the Internet tools you can automatically upgrade the system. For example, authorized a Redhat Linux operating system, or a Centos Linux system, as long as your system can connect to the Internet, type yum update automatically upgrade the system can be realized. System upgrade through yum yum command to download the essence of the specified remote host on the Internet, RPM packages, and then automatically installed, while addressing the dependencies between various software. <br /> Manually upgrade is targeted for a system software upgrade, such as upgrading the system ssh login tools, gcc compile tools. Manually upgrade is actually achieved through the RPM package software update tool, so you may encounter when upgrading software dependencies between the software upgrade is relatively trouble. <br /> The following specific about how to set up in Centos Linux4.4 yum tools to perform system updates. <br /> 1. yum installation and configuration (1) yum yum check whether the installation has been installed: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-qa | grep yum <br /> If there is no any indication that the system not yet installed yum tool, yum centos system CD in the installation package can be found, perform the following command to install: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh yum-*. noarch.rpm <br /> Need to install yum python-elementtree, python-sqlite, urlgrabber, yumconf other support packages, these packages in Centos Linux system installation CD-ROM can be found, if occurred during the installation package yum dependency between, just according to rely on tips to find the corresponding package can be installed until the yum package installed successfully. <br /> The following is an example of the installation environment: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch.rpm <br /> warning: yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> error: Failed dependencies: <br /> python-elementtree is needed by yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch <br /> python-sqlite is needed by yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch <br /> urlgrabber is needed by yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch <br /> yumconf is needed by yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh python-elementtree-1.2.6-4.2.1.i386.rpm <br /> warning: python-elementtree-1.2.6-4.2.1.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: python-elementtree ########################################### [100 %] <br /> <a href=\"mailto:root@localhost\">root @ localhost</a> ~] # rpm-ivh sqlite-3.3.3-1.2.i386.rpm <br /> warning: sqlite-3.3.3-1.2.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: sqlite ########################################### [100%] <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh python-sqlite-1.1.7-1.2.i386.rpm <br /> warning: python-sqlite-1.1.7-1.2.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: python-sqlite ########################################### [100 %] <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh python-urlgrabber-2.9.8-2.noarch.rpm <br /> warning: python-urlgrabber-2.9.8-2.noarch.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: python-urlgrabber ########################################### [100 %] <br /> <a href=\"mailto:root@localhost\">root @ localhost</a> ~] # rpm-ivh CentOS-yumconf-4-4.5.noarch.rpm <br /> warning: centos-yumconf-4-4.5.noarch.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: centos-yumconf ########################################### [100 %] <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch.rpm <br /> warning: yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: yum ########################################### [100%] <br /> (2) yum configuration <br /> yum tool installed, the next job is to carry out the configuration of yum, yum configuration file has the main configuration file / etc / yum.conf, repository configuration directory / etc / yum.repos.d, yum install, the default number of Library configuration may not be used, hence the need for change, the following is / etc / yum.repos.d / CentOS-Base.repo repository of the detailed meaning of the configuration file: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # / etc / yum.repos.d / CentOS-Base.repo <br /> [Base] <br /> name = CentOS-4 - Base <br /> # Name is the name of release in the format that &quot;the operating system name and release version&quot;, &quot;base&quot; is that this section is the base package to find information.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">baseurl = http://mirror.centos.org/centos/4/os/ $ basearch / <br /> # Baseurl &quot;said yum upgrade file on the Internet to find the URL address.

From the VM specification, we can get, about several exceptions. </p><p> <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">java.lang.StackOverflowError: (rare) <br /> java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: heap space (more common) <br /> java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space (often)</span></strong> </p><p> <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded (an action occurs when using a lot of memory)</span></strong> </p><p> The following are explained, from the beginning of the most common: </p><p> <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space</span></strong> this anomaly more common, is that JVM memory area in the Perm abnormal overflow, the JVM in the default case, Perm default is 64M, and many programs need a lot of Perm region memory, especially with to other frameworks like Spring, because of need to use dynamically generated classes, and these classes can not be GC automatically released, thus resulting in OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space exception. Solution is simple, increase the JVM\'s-XX: MaxPermSize startup parameters, we can solve this problem, such as through the use of the default variable is usually 64M [5.0 and newer: 64 bit VMs are scaled 30% larger; 1.4 amd64: 96m ; 1.3.1-client: 32m.], changed to 128M on it,-XX: MaxPermSize = 128m. If you have a 128m (Eclipse has a 128m a) to change the 256m. I usually on the server for security reasons, change the 256m. </p><p> <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: heap space</span></strong> or other OutOfMemoryError, this exception is actually with the above exception is an exception, but the solutions are different, so separate write. Above, that exception is because the JVM\'s perm area caused less distinction between memory (JVM\'s memory is divided into young, old, perm three). And this exception is because the JVM heap memory or less total points. The solution is to change-Xms-Xmx startup parameter, usually 1-fold increase. xms is to manage the minimum amount of memory at startup, xmx tube JVM is the largest amount of memory. <br /> Note: OutOfMemoryError may have a variety of reasons, according to JVM Specification, may be about several situations, I briefly listed. stack: stack partition can not be dynamically expanded, or not enough to generate a new thread. Heap: need more memory, but can not get. Method Area: If you can not satisfy the distribution requirements. runtime constant pool (from the Method Area allocate memory) enough to create a class or interface. native method stacks can not be dynamically expanded, or create new native thread. </p><p></p><p> <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded,</span></strong> this is the type of error JDK6 Xintian. Occurs in the GC takes a lot of time when the release occurred in a small space, is a protective mechanism. JSP guide I encountered when a large Excel. The final solution is to disable the function, use the --XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit </p><p> Finally talk about <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000\">java.lang.StackOverflowError,</span></strong> honestly I have not met the exception too, but the JVM Specification to mention, norms, said there are about several situations may throw the exception, one is allowed Stacks in the threads over time the other is when the native method requires more memory, and more than native method when the memory allows. According to SUN\'s documentation, improve-XX: ThreadStackSize = 512 value. </p><p> JVM memory tuning in general, group purpose is to use memory as small as possible, and make the program run properly, do not throw the net overflow bug. But should be fine minimum memory, maximum memory of the ratio of GC time to avoid wasting too much time, especially to avoid FULL GC. </p><p></p><p> Added: Since JDK1.4 added nio, nio the buffer memory is allocated and rather special (read and write streams can be shared memory). If you have a large number of data exchange, may also lead to java.lang.OutOfMemoryError. The corresponding JDK added a special parameter:-XX: MaxDirectMemorySize default is 64M, you can change something as big 128M. </p><p> -XX: MaxDirectMemorySize = &lt;size&gt; <br /> Specifies the maximum amount of memory in bytes that the Java Ã¢Â„Â¢ NIO library can allocate for direct memory buffers. The default is 64 megabytes, which corresponds to <br /> -XX: MaxDirectMemorySize = 64m. The use of direct memory buffers can minimize the copying cost when doing I / O operations. </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>'),(199,'linux','en','/a/web/tomcat/2010/0426/81.html','java.lang.OutOfMemoryError error summary','2010-04-26','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><div><p> <font face=\"Verdana\" size=\"2\"><strong>1, Permanent Generation space problem</strong> <br /><br /> PermGen space stands for Permanent Generation space, refers to the memory of the permanent preservation areas OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space benefits from a surface is the memory, the solution must also be increased memory.

This model comes in the request can not re-spawn a new process, which reduces the system overhead in order to increase performance. MaxSpareServers set the maximum number of idle processes, and if this value is greater than the number of idle process, Apache will automatically kill off some redundant process. Do not set this value too large, but if MinSpareServers smaller than the value set, Apache will automatically adjust it to MinSpareServers +1. <br /> If the site loads more, consider the same time increase MinSpareServers and MaxSpareServers. MaxRequestsPerChild set is that each child process to handle the requests. Each child in dealing with the &quot;MaxRequestsPerChild&quot; requests will be automatically destroyed. 0 means unlimited, and that the child will never be destroyed. Although the default is set to 0, so that each child process can handle more requests, but set to a nonzero value if there are two important advantages: 1, prevents accidental memory leaks. 2, in the server load down at the right time will automatically reduce the number of child processes. Therefore, according to the load on the server to adjust this value. MaxClients is the most important of these instructions, a set that Apache can handle the request, the greatest impact is the performance parameters of Apache. The default value of 150 is not enough, if the total number of requests has reached this value (via ps-ef | grep http | wc-l to confirm), then subsequent requests will queue until the completion of a request has been processed . This is a lot of system resources while remaining the main reason for HTTP access is very slow. Although theoretically the higher the value, the more requests can be handled, but the restrictions can not be greater than the default Apache 256. ServerLimit recompile Apache directive can not increase the MaxClients. <br /> &lt;IfModule Prefork.c&gt; <br /> ServerLimit 10000 <br /> StartServers 5 <br /> MinSpareServers 5 <br /> MaxSpareServers 10 <br /> MaxClients 10000 <br /> MaxRequestsPerChild 0 <br /> &lt;/ IfModule&gt; </p><p> Worker </p><p> Relative to the prefork, worker support for the new multi-threaded and multi-process mixture model MPM. The use of threads to handle, so it can handle the request of the relative mass, and the system resources is less than the cost of process-based server. However, worker also uses a number of processes, each process has generated more than one thread to get the stability of the server-based process. In the configure-with-mpm = worker after the make build, make install to install. Generated in the default httpd-mpm.conf has the following default configuration section: </p><p> &lt;IfModule Worker.c&gt; <br /> StartServers 2 <br /> MaxClients 150 <br /> MinSpareThreads 25 <br /> MaxSpareThreads 75 <br /> ThreadsPerChild 25 <br /> MaxRequestsPerChild 0 <br /> &lt;/ IfModule&gt; </p><p> Worker process generated by the master control &quot;StartServers&quot; sub-processes, each child process ThreadsPerChild contains a fixed number of threads, each thread independently handle the request. Similarly, in order to not generate thread again when a request comes, MinSpareThreads and MaxSpareThreads set the minimum and maximum number of idle threads; while at the same time MaxClients set the maximum number of incoming clients. If the existing number of threads in the child process can not meet the load, the control process will derive a new child process. MinSpareThreads and MaxSpareThreads maximum default values are 75 and 250. These two parameters did not affect the performance of Apache can be adjusted accordingly in accordance with the actual situation. <br /> ThreadsPerChild worker MPM is most closely associated with the performance of the instruction. The default value is the maximum ThreadsPerChild 64, if the load the larger, 64 is not enough. Explicitly use this time to ThreadLimit directive that the maximum default value is 20000. Worker mode, the total number of requests can be processed simultaneously by ThreadsPerChild value multiplied by the total number of child processes of decision, should be greater than equal to MaxClients. If the load is large, the number of existing child process can not meet, the control process will derive a new child process. The largest number of child processes by default is 16, increase the need to explicitly declare when ServerLimit (maximum is 20,000). Note that, if explicitly declared ServerLimit, then it must be multiplied by a value greater than or equal ThreadsPerChild MaxClients, and MaxClients ThreadsPerChild must be an integer multiple, otherwise Apache will automatically adjust to an appropriate value. <br /> &lt;IfModule Worker.c&gt; <br /> ServerLimit 25 <br /> ThreadLimit 200 <br /> StartServers 3 <br /> MaxClients 2000 <br /> MinSpareThreads 50 <br /> MaxSpareThreads 200 <br /> ThreadsPerChild 100 <br /> MaxRequestsPerChild 0 <br /> &lt;/ IfModule&gt; </p><p> The following is a testing tool built using Apache ab to test the situation on the Server (set the requested index page is 6bytes), cpu% occupancy rate for the cpu, mem for the memory usage (M units), RequestsPerSecond per second processing number of requests. </p><p> 1, Prefor way (ServerLimit, StartServer, MinSpareServers, MaxSpareServers, MaxClients, MaxRequestPerChild) </p><p> -n/-c (ab parameter) Cpu% Mem Requestspersecond <br /> (-, 5,5,10,150,0) <br /> 100000/100 28.8 2,858,434 <br /> 100000/200 29.2 3,048,032 <br /> 100000/500 25.3 3,237,348 <br /> 100000/1000 24.4 3,305,886 <br /> (10000,5,5,10,500,0) <br /> 100000/100 28.7 3,718,345 <br /> 100000/200 27.4 3,897,929 <br /> 100000/500 24.9 4,177,229 <br /> 100000/1000 23.4 4,376,676 <br /> (10000,5,5,10,1000,0) <br /> 100000/100 28.8 4,088,517 <br /> 100000/200 27.0 4,228,045 <br /> 100000/500 24.2 4,557,236 <br /> 100000/1000 22.5 4,706,570 <br /> (10000,5,5,10,1500,0) <br /> 100000/100 29.6 3,308,407 <br /> 100000/200 28.1 3,498,014 <br /> 100000/500 26.4 3,807,290 <br /> 100000/1000 24.0 4,006,686 </p><p> 2, Worker mode </p><p> (ServerLimt, Threadlimt, Startservers, MaxClients, MinspareThread, MaxspareThread, ThreadperChild, MaxRequestPerChild) <br /> -n/-c (ab parameter) cpu% mem RequestsperSecond <br /> (50,500,5,10000,50,200,200,0) <br /> 100000/100 18.6 1,886,020 <br /> 100000/200 20.1 1,955,892 <br /> 100000/500 19.8 2,095,708 <br /> 100000/1000 22.2 2,186,081 <br /> (100,500,5,10000,50,200,100,0) <br /> 100000/100 24.5 2,406,919 <br /> 100000/200 23.6 2,476,798 <br /> 100000/500 24.6 2,546,827 <br /> 100000/1000 22.3 2,716,114 <br /> (200,500,5,10000,50,200,50,0) <br /> 100000/100 27.3 3,017,781 <br /> 100000/200 27.4 3,077,789 <br /> 100000/500 26.0 3,207,141 <br /> 100000/1000 21.8 3,446,110 <br /> Relatively speaking, prefork mode speed to slightly higher than the worker, but it requires the cpu and memory resources are also slightly more than woker. </p><p> How to know the current application mode apache </p><p> httpd-l If you have prefork.c prefork way that is, if it is worker.c that work mode. <br /> Reason busy site requires you to conduct your analysis.

Array architecture varies with each array, they also exist within the bandwidth (similar to the pc the system bus), but under normal circumstances, the internal bandwidth is designed to be adequate, not where the bottleneck. <br /> The impact of fiber channel is relatively large, such as data warehousing environment, data flow requirements of a large, and a 2Gb Fibre card, can support the maximum flow should be 2Gb / 8 (small B) = 250MB / s ( Big B) the actual flow, when the four fiber cards in order to achieve 1GB / s of the actual flow, so the data warehouse environment can be considered for 4Gb Fibre card. <br /> Finally, talk about hard limits, here is the most important bottlenecks in the current surface, when no longer exists, depends on the number of hard drives, and I look at the different hard drives listed below can support the flow of size: <br /> 10 K rpm 15 K rpm ATA <br /> --- --- --- <br /> 10M / s 13M / s 8M / s <br /> So, assuming there is an array of optical fiber 120 15K rpm hard disk, the drive can support the largest flow is 120 * 13 = 1560MB / s, 2Gb Fibre card if it is, you may need six to be able to, and 4Gb Fibre Cards 3-4 is enough. </p><p> 2, IOPS <br /> The main decision depends on the array IOPS algorithm, cache hit rate, and the disk number. Array algorithm for different arrays vary, as we have recently encountered in the hds usp above, probably because ldev (lun) queue or resource constraints exist, and a single ldev the iops would not increase, so, before using this store is necessary to understand some of the storage algorithm rules and restrictions. <br /> cache hit rate depends on the data distribution, cache size the size of the data access rules, and cache algorithms, if the full discussion down here will become very complicated, can one day good discussion. I am here only to emphasize a cache hit rate, if an array, read cache hit rate as high as possible, the general said it could support more IOPS, Why? The following should be discussed with us the hard disk IOPS with relationship. <br /> Hard constraints, each physical hard disk can handle is limited IOPS, such as 10 K rpm 15 K rpm ATA <br /> --- --- --- <br /> 10,015,050 <br /> Similarly, if there is an array of optical fiber 120 15K rpm hard drive, then it can sustain the maximum IOPS of 120 * 150 = 18,000, the limit of the theoretical value for the hardware, if more than this value, the hard disk of the response may become very slow and can not properly provide services. <br /> In addition, we also discussed on the article in raid5 and raid10, read iops no difference, however, the same business writing iops, ultimately rests on the disk iops there is a difference, and we evaluated it is exactly the disk IOPS, limit if it reaches the disk, the performance is certainly not increase the. <br /> We assume that a case, the business iops is 10,000, read cache hit rate is 30%, 60% read iops, write iops 40%, the disk number is 120, then calculate the situation in raid5 and raid10, each a disk iops have. </p><p> IXDBA.NET Technical Community </p><p> raid5: </p><p> Single-block disk iops = (10000 * (1-0.3) * 0.6 + 4 * (10000 * 0.4)) / 120 <br /> = (4200 + 16000) / 120 <br /> = 168 <br /> Here 10000 * (1-0.3) * 0.6 that is read iops, ratio is 0.6, get rid of cache hit, actually, only 4,200 iops <br /> The 4 * (10000 * 0.4) that the written iops, because each write, in raid5, the actual occurrence of the four io, so write iops to 16,000 </p><p> Raid5 in order to consider when writing, it read 2 hits can also occur, so a more accurate calculation is: </p><p> Single-block disk iops = (10000 * (1-0.3) * 0.6 + 2 * (10000 * 0.4) * (1-0.3) + 2 * (10000 * 0.4)) / 120 <br /> = (4200 + 5600 + 8000) / 120 <br /> = 148 <br /> Iops calculated as a single disk 148, the basic disk limit reached </p><p> raid10 </p><p> Single-block disk iops = (10000 * (1-0.3) * 0.6 + 2 * (10000 * 0.4)) / 120 <br /> = (4200 + 8000) / 120 <br /> = 102 <br /> You can see, because raid10 for a write operation, occurs only 2 times io, therefore, the same pressure, the same disk, each disk iops only 102, far below the limit of the disk iops. </p><p> In a practical case, a lot of pressure recovery standby (here mainly to write, and write a small io), using a raid5 solution, found poor performance, by analyzing each disk iops during peak periods , fast 200, resulting in extremely slow response speed giant. Later transformed into raid10, to avoid this performance problem, each disk iops down to 100 or so. <br /></p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>'),(213,'linux','en','/a/st/2010/0711/306.html','How to choose your own level raid','2010-07-11','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> How to choose the right RAID level? </p><p> There are different RAID configuration or &quot;class&quot;, each level has its own unique advantages. Understand the RAID level to enable you to determine the server reliability, data availability and storage performance of the right combination to meet specific e-business needs. Intel Integrated RAID software supports the most widely used RAID level: 0,1,5, and 10. </p><p> RAID 0 level will be assigned to the data base with more than one disk, there is no redundancy or parity. The main features of the RAID level is extremely high data throughput speeds. Data access to multiple disks make disk access more efficient, which improves read performance data. Any one disk fails the data stored will be lost </p><p> Copy using two hard drives store data, we implemented a RAID1-level (called disk mirroring), in most cases through the software. If a hard disk fails, it will be all the data (and software applications) to save to another hard disk. Although it provides maximum fault tolerance, but requires twice the disk number, so RAID1 level is extremely expensive option. With the declining cost of disk technology, RAID1-level optimization of data availability has become a viable option. </p><p> RAID 5 level will baseband section and the &quot;parity&quot; the combination together, this case, the data distribution in the online group\'s hard drive. Parity RAID controller data to understand the data stored on your hard drive. Suppose that a hard disk fails, the controller can use the parity information to re-create the lost data. RAID5-level data to allow both read and write, which is data-intensive applications that require high performance provided support. You can adjust the size of the baseband section to optimize performance, the Intel Integrated RAID software support this feature.

SAN-based backup is a completely solve the need to occupy the traditional backup solutions for LAN bandwidth issues. It uses a new architecture, the tape library and disk array of fiber each node as an independent, multi-host shared tape library backup, data flow through the network no longer directly transmitted from the disk array, tape library, network bandwidth is a need (LAN-Free) solutions. </p><p> With the current SAN technology continues to progress, LAN-Free structure is already quite mature, and Server-Free backup structure is not mature enough. </p><p> LAN-Free has the advantage of unified management of data backup, backup speed, network transmission pressure is small, tape library resource sharing; disadvantage is that high investment. </p><p> Using IBM Tivoly Storage Manager software, with IBM LTO tape library, etc., can achieve all of these backups. </p><p></p><p> other <br /> The choice of data backup </p><p> The main ways of the current data backup: LAN backup, LAN Free backup and SAN Server-Free backup of three. LAN backup for all storage types are available, LAN Free backup and SAN Server-Free backup for SAN-based storage only. </p><p> Traditional LAN-based backup requires the backup on each host to install a tape backup on the local system, using LAN backup strategy, when the data is not very big, centralized backup can be used. A central backup server will be installed in the LAN, and then the application server and workstation configured as a backup server to the client. Accept the central backup server running the backup on the client agent\'s request, the data passed to it through the management LAN, connected to a local tape drive resources. This approach provides a centralized, easy to manage backup program, and through the sharing of tape drives in the network resource efficiency. </p><p> LAN-Free backup of the data transmitted through the LAN, when a larger amount of data to backup, backup tight time window, the network prone to clogging. In the SAN environment, can be stored in the network LAN-Free backup, you need to backup the server through the SAN to connect to the tape machine, the LAN-Free backup client software trigger, the read data to back up, back up through the SAN to a shared the tape drive. This independent network LAN traffic can not be transferred, and its CPU resources required to operate way below the LAN, because the fiber channel connection does not require the server\'s TCP / IP stack, and some level of error checking can be within the Fibre Channel hardware to complete. In many solutions require a host to manage the shared storage devices and data used to find and restore the backup database. </p><p> SAN Server-Free Backup LAN Free backup on the need to take back the host CPU resources, if the backup process can be completed within the SAN, and a large number of data streams without flow through the server, you can greatly reduce the backup of the production system. SAN Server-Free backup is one such technology. </p><p> Backup the current mainstream software, such as IBM Tivoli, Veritas, were in support of the three backup programs. Three programs, LAN backup of the smallest amount of data, most of the server resource consumption, the lowest cost; LAN free backup data volume number, smaller footprint on the server, the cost higher; SAN Server-free backup solution to backup in a short time large amounts of data, at least on the server resource consumption, but the highest cost. Small customers can choose according to the actual situation. <br /> other </p><p> Traditional Backup: How helpless wits </p><p> In the traditional backup mode, each host is equipped with a dedicated disk or tape storage systems, host of the data must be backed up to tape in the device or special local disk array. Thus, even if a tape drive (or tape library) is idle, the other host can not use it for backup, the tape resource utilization is low. In addition, different operating system platforms used in backup and recovery procedures are generally not the same, which makes the backup job and overall management of resources becomes more complex. </p><p> Later, to produce a special tape to overcome the low utilization rate of the improvements of the system: the resource by a master tape backup / restore server control, and backup and recovery process is controlled by some management software. Master backup server to receive the other server through LAN or WAN incoming data and the disk or tape into the public system. This centralized storage in ways that greatly improved the efficiency of resource use tape. But it also has a fatal deficiency: network bandwidth will be the backup and recovery process of the potential bottlenecks. </p><p> Is there a more advanced solution, when the backup system to minimize resource consumption, while ensuring the system\'s high availability and flexibility? </p><p> LAN-free backup: The first one mundane children </p><p> One way is to use LAN-free technology. The so-called LAN-free, the data is backed up directly without a local area network, that user can simply tape drive or tape library and other backup device connected to the SAN, each server to be backed up data can be sent directly to the shared backup device do not have to go through local area network links. Because the server to share large data storage devices is carried out through the SAN network, LAN, bear only the communication between the server (rather than data transfer) missions. </p><p> 2 common means of implementation </p><p> LAN-free implementation of a variety of ways. Typically, users need for each server with a Fibre Channel adapter, the adapter is responsible for these servers connected to one or more tape drives (or tape library) connected to SAN. At the same time, with a particular need for the server management software, through which the system able to block format data from the server memory, the SAN tape drive or transferred to the tape library. </p><p> There is also a common implementation of LAN-free approach, in this structure, the main backup server management software can start the other server data backup operations. Block format of the data from the disk array through the SAN to store data transmitted to the temporary memory of the backup server, after transmission through SAN to the tape drive or tape library. </p><p> LAN-free backup inadequate </p><p> &quot;No one is perfect&quot;, LAN-free technology is also less than obvious. First, it is still involved in the server backup data from one storage device to another storage device in the process, to a certain extent, take up valuable CPU processing time and server memory. Another problem is, LAN-free recovery technology, unsatisfactory, it is very dependent on the user\'s application. Many products do not support file-level or directory-level recovery, image-level recovery to become more common. Image-level recovery is to copy the image from the tape back to disk, if you need to quickly restore a single file, the whole operation will become very troublesome. </p><p> In addition, different vendors implement LAN-free mechanism to vary, which causes the backup process will be required for compatibility problems between systems. </p><p> LAN-free implementation of the complex and often require large hardware and software purchasing costs. </p><p> Serverless Backup: icing on the cake The second measure children </p><p> Another way to reduce resource consumption of the system approach is to use no server (Serverless) backup technology. It is an extension of LAN-free, can provide data to the SAN structure in the direct transmission between the two storage devices, usually between disk arrays and tape libraries. One of the main advantages of this approach is the need for caching data in the server, significantly reduces host CPU occupancy, improve the efficiency of the operating system to help companies do more work. </p><p> 2 common means of implementation </p><p> As with LAN-free, non-implementation of the server backups are also several ways. Typically, the backup data through a device called the Data Mover transfers from the disk array to the tape library. The device may be Fibre Channel switches, storage routers, intelligent tape or disk device or a server. Data Mover command is executed to transfer data from one storage device to another device. One way to implement this process is by means of SCSI-3 extended copy command, which enables the server to send commands to the storage device, instructions which transfer data directly to another device, without going through server memory. Received extended copy data mover command, perform the appropriate function. </p><p> Another method is to use the Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP). This agreement is actually for the server, backup and recovery applications and backup devices and other components to act as an interface between the communication. In the implementation process, NDMP to commands from the server to the backup application, with the NDMP-compliant backup software will start the actual work of data transmission and data transmission is not through the server memory. The purpose is to facilitate the NDMP heterogeneous backup and recovery environment process and enhance backup and recovery of different vendors management software and storage hardware compatibility. </p><p> The advantages of server-backup </p><p> No server backup and LAN-free backup has many similar advantages. If no server backup, the source device, the destination device and the SAN devices are the main components of the data channel. Although the server is still involved in the backup process, but greatly reduce the burden, because it is basically similar to the role of traffic police, only for the command, not used for loading and transport, not the primary backup data channel. </p><p> Serverless backup technology to shorten backup and recovery with the time spent advantages. Because the backup process on the dedicated high-speed storage network, and the decision is a storage device throughput speed, rather than the server\'s processing power, so the system performance will be greatly enhanced. In addition, if no-server backup technology, data can be transmitted in the form of data streams to multiple tape libraries or disk arrays. </p><p> As for shortcomings, though greatly reduced the burden on the server, but still need a backup application software (and its host server) to control the backup process. Metadata must be recorded in the database backup software, which still need to take up CPU resources. </p><p> As with LAN-free, non-server backup mentioned above may lead to the same kind of compatibility issues. Moreover, no server backup may be difficult and costly. Finally, if no server backup applications to be more extensive and greater recovery function remains to be improved. </p><p> Balancing the pros and cons and then decided upon </p><p> We discussed earlier under the Fibre Channel environment, LAN-free and serverless backup technology, because some structural integration of IP-based technology, such as iSCSI, especially as future IP storage network storage technology in the possession of strong advantages, LAN- free and serverless backup technology solutions will become more widespread. </p><p> LAN-free and serverless backup is not suitable for all applications. If you have a large data repository to be 7 ÃƒÂ— 24 readily available, no server backup may be a good choice. But must ensure that you have made it clear how long the recovery process, because this will underestimate the face a more serious problem than at the beginning. </p><p> On the other hand, if you have a database of moderate size can tolerate some downtime, then the traditional backup and recovery technology may be your quite good choice. </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>'),(216,'linux','en','/a/st/2010/0711/303.html','Troubleshooting and maintenance of disk arrays Notes','2010-07-11','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> The following information easily lead to loss of RAID disk array: <br /> 1.

However, it is put in consideration the hands of the SUSE Linux operating system, Linux is likely to be of the traditional pattern of a powerful weapon. <br /> Linux industry, the traditional pattern, Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu Linux form the top three. Despite the apparently Ubuntu does not encroach on enterprise Linux market, but in some workstation hardware, Ubuntu is quite a market. <br /> According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that, VMware could get their Linux Novell acquired assets. Novell VMware acquisition talks with many vendors. Novell is currently being considered for divestment, including VMware is working with at least two vendors, including high-level talks. <br /> Thus, if once acquired VMware hand, will help VMware in the context of broader market into the clouds. VMware is the virtualization of the most powerful companies, once for SUSE Linux and VMware virtualization technology in conjunction with, will inevitably create a strong competitor to Red Hat, the impact of the latter is self-evident. As a result, Red Hat Linux\'s dominant position, most likely not be maintained. <br /> Another way of saying that the possible acquisition of SUSE Linux is IBM. IBM and Red Hat have many years of cooperation, if IBM is determined to acquire SuSE, whether it will continue to maintain this relationship depends on how IBM SuSE have a bit of hope. May in any case, once the IBM acquisition of SuSE, in the next few years will pose a threat to Red Hat, although a direct financial impact will not be more than 60 million per year. <br /> More worse, IBM has used the line software and hardware product lines. IBM back in 2000 to drop it into the billions of dollars to support Linux, and now all of its product line can be no barrier into Linux. Once the full support of some kind of IBM Linux, its influence is limitless. <br /> There is also a view that he may come forward to buy Red Hat, SUSE Linux. However, because Red Hat and SUSE high degree of overlap of business and the acquisition would mean in the next 5 to 7 years, have to bear the financial support of SuSE. Therefore, the Red Hat acquisition is unlikely. But only this possibility is the Red Hat Linux to consolidate its industry in the boss position. The combination of SUSE and Red Hat, but also may give the next part of the brand of Linux to the market space. <br /> Indeed, the rise of Linux has by no means the brand is not possible. September 21, Oracle\'s global technology and application of the General Assembly, Oracle announced that Oracle software and hardware to optimize the introduction of a fast, modern and reliable enterprise-class Oracle Unbreakable Linux kernel core. Within the Oracle software and hardware industrial chain has improved steadily after, Oracle Unbreakable Linux is playing an increasingly larger stage. And industry experts generally believe that Oracle\'s acquisition of VMware far less likely to have large, and Oracle\'s acquisition will not cause too much of the current market share. <br /> Thus, with the approaching date of acquisition SUSE Linux, Red Hat\'s leadership position may not be preserved, Oracle Unbreakable Linux is constantly looking for the opportunity to host. The most elusive is the SUSE Linux, it decided to change the industry, but also to sway their own destiny to become uncertain. Regardless of where to change, Linux industry may be at the eve of regime change.</span></span> </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>'),(234,'linux','en','/a/os/linux/2010/0507/98.html','New book &quot;Linux the essence of enterprise applications,&quot; being finalized, release all','2010-05-07','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> Blink of an eye, &quot;step by step Linux&quot; has been published six months, and in the process, received a lot of letters from readers and counseling, including encouragement have different opinions, but certainly the majority, to get everyone\'s approval and support, I am very pleased, thank you for the encouragement and support consistent, because this is just the beginning, I believe I can do better! </p><p> &quot;Step by step Linux&quot; has been reprinted once, fixed some errors in the first edition, once again thank the support of readers, of which 60% of the amendments when the feedback from readers is very grateful to these loyal readers, your support is I wrote this book the greatest power! </p><p> In the &quot;step by step Linux&quot; published after the editor again to receive the invitation to write one more suitable for intermediate and advanced users of Linux enthusiasts and technical books, in my initiative, two senior members of Linux have been added our creative team, so a new book about the birth of linux technology! </p><p> Write a blog is easy, free to play, but create a book for readers of all classes is not easy, created the hardship, only to understand and experience of!

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 in March 2007 was first released, self-released, through a number of regularly updated. Last month, we have just released the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 the 5th updated with new features and hardware support. In 2014, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 platform, Red Hat will continue to be, and its ISV and OEM partners for their support. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Looking to the future, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 blurred virtual, physical, and the boundaries between cloud computing to adapt to contemporary changes occurring in IT environments. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 from the kernel to the application infrastructure to the development tool chain is used to upgrade the core technology to meet the future generations of hardware and software technology needs. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> New version of the theme, including the ubiquitous virtualization, better stability and high availability, higher energy efficiency and to provide more than the latest software technology. Beta version released today on the occasion, we will introduce several new and noteworthy improvements: </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Comprehensive power management capabilities </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Ã¢Â—Â‹ time kernel to improve the system there will be no more frequently active task processor becomes idle state. This will lead to a lower temperature than previous versions and higher CPU power saving. Powertop other new monitoring tools that can help identify energy problems can be solved, thus further reducing energy consumption. Like a &quot;tuned&quot; so that the new regulation tool (an adaptive system regulating daemon) service the system can adjust the energy usage pattern analysis. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Performance Improvement </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Ã¢Â—Â‹ Red Hat engineers we plan to appear in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 performance improvements in a variety of upstream development kernel play a key role in the process of completely rewriting the scheduler so that it can make the process a higher priority at the lowest limit lower priority treatment under the conditions of interference, a more equitable distribution among the processor computation time. In addition, for a variety of multi-processor lock synchronization improvements. For example, to eliminate unnecessary lock events, many of rotation instead of using the sleep lock (spin) lock and a more efficient locking primitives. Impact of these fundamental changes to many core subsystems. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Improved scalability </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Ã¢Â—Â‹ The new hardware has led to major developments in commodity computing platforms. For example, now a 5U rack cabinet can hold 64 CPU and 2TB of memory. These systems and their subsequent products will be Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to achieve the scalability limits. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is one of the main features: it can provide scalability to adapt to future systems. The scalability of capacity from a large number of CPU and memory configuration for the optimization of the support to handle a larger number of systems the ability to interconnect bus and peripherals. With bare metal virtualization becomes ubiquitous, like the time of deployment, the ability of the environment suitable for bare metal and virtual environments. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> New security features </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Ã¢Â—Â‹ called security services daemon (SSSD) of the new service provides a centralized identity management. It also has a cache for offline use certificate capabilities. New SELinux sandbox feature allows untrusted content can not affect the system in an isolated environment for the rest of the run. This includes the isolation of any Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 running on a virtual client capabilities. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Resource Management </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Ã¢Â—Â‹ called in a control group (ie cgroups) with the help of a new framework, the new system provides the hardware resources of fine-grained control, distribution and management. cgroups running in process group level, can be used for application management from the CPU, memory, network and disk I / O resources. The framework is also used to manage virtual clients. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Virtualization </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Ã¢Â—Â‹ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 extends the earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux integrated virtualization based on KVM technology. The new system has more than one performance, scheduler and hardware improvements, no matter what the deployment model to provide better flexibility and control. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Storage </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Ã¢Â—Â‹ FCoE and iSCSI protocols through the network block storage support, so use LVM / DM to change the implementation of online and multi-path mirrored volume size possible. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> File System </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Ã¢Â—Â‹ new system includes the ext4 file system. Extended family of next-generation file system, which includes support for larger file sizes, more efficient disk space allocation, better and more robust file system check log. In addition to ext4, we also intend to provide XFS? File system. XFS? For large files and directories, including debris removal and the like when used in the file system the ability to change the file system size. Level has risen to NFS version 4, which includes IPv6 support. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Ã¢Â—Â‹ new version of the use of new hardware such as hot-add capability to provide equipment and hardware and equipment through the enhanced PCIe AER of error checking and other features. It will also include advanced data integrity features (DIF / DIX). Such characteristics of the hardware from the application of inspection and survey data. ABRT (automatic bug report tool) provides the introduction of the system to identify and report anomalies such as the core DD fault (kernel oops) and user space applications crash DD more consistent manner. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Compilers and tools </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Ã¢Â—Â‹ GCC compiler has been upgraded to version 4.4. This version of the draft in accordance with C + + 0x standard compilation. It is also consistent with OpenMP 3.0, includes a number of debugging. SystemTap improvements include better user support for space exploration, more secure server and compile the script to make SystemTap non-root user can access the new non-privileged mode. In addition, there are many other new compiler has been upgraded to the latest version of the library and more languages and operating environment, including a complete LAMP stack and OpenJDK. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Desktop </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Introduced a new version of the display type of testing and support for multiple monitors. We also added support for NVIDIA graphics device driver for the upgrade of the new. Of course, if GNOME and KDE desktop does not update the new version will be incomplete. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 in a variety of technology hardware platform as the key to the expansion of support provided, we believe that these technologies will become a new platform to attract new customers an attractive choice. As always, the new version is part of the value of our enterprise certification. </p><p class=\"newtext\"> Currently, thousands of applications in Red Hat Enterprise Linux by running the certification, whether it runs on &quot;bare metal&quot; deployment, virtualization deployment, or cloud deployment.

After pressure testing and certification, in the case of many concurrent connections, CPU processing power is stronger, the system runs faster. . <br /> SceneÃ£Â€Â‘ Ã£Â€Âapply to any project. <br /> <strong>Second, Java Virtual Machine tuning</strong> &lt;br /&gt; should choose SUN\'s JVM, the premise of meeting the needs of the project as far as selection of a higher version of JVM, generally high version of the product than the low speed and efficiency will be improved versions of . <br /> JDK1.4 JDK1.3 performance improvement than the nearly 10% -20%, JDK1.5 JDK1.4 than 25% -75% performance increase. <br /> Therefore, the situation on the high performance requirements recommended JDK1.6. <br /> SceneÃ£Â€Â‘ Ã£Â€Âapply to any project. <br /> <strong>Third, Apache Integration <u><a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/web/tomcat/\">Tomcat</a></u></strong> <br /> HTTP Web server dedicated to handling requests, the application server is provided through a number of protocols for the application business logic. While the Tomcat web server can also be made, but the deal\'s not as fast as static html Apache, and web server functionality as far as Apache, so Apache and Tomcat to integrate, will feature some html and Jsp clear division of labor, Jsp Tomcat parts to deal only with the other by the Apache, IIS and other web servers to handle, thus greatly improving the operating efficiency of Tomcat. <br /> If a project makes extensive use of static pages, a large number of pictures and have a greater number of visits, integrated Apache Tomcat recommended way to improve overall system performance. <br /> The integration of Apache and Tomcat, there are three ways, namely, JK, http_proxy and ajp_proxy. Where JK is the most common way of approach, JK itself has two versions 1 and 2, respectively, present a new version is 1.2.8, and version 2 already obsolete. http_proxy is to use Apache\'s mod_proxy module is built using agent technology to connect to Tomcat. Ajp_proxy connection with the http_proxy the same way as a matter of fact, all the functions provided by the mod_proxy. Just need to configure the http:// into ajp: / /, while the connection is where Tomcat\'s AJP Connector port. <br /> JK\'s connections with respect to the latter two is relatively simple in configuration, flexibility, a little also favorably. But in terms of stability of not JK proven so, so JK\'s connection is recommended. <br /> Apache + JK + Tomcat configuration: <br /> The two configuration files used are: httpd.conf and mod_jk.conf. Which is the Apache server\'s httpd.conf configuration file to load the JK module, and specify the JK configuration file information. mod_jk.conf is connected to the Tomcat server definition file. <br /> Ã£Â€Â‘ Ã£Â€ÂDeployment steps <br /> 1. Installing Apache Server <br /> 2. Deployment Tomcat <br /> 3. Mod_jk.so copy the modules directory <br /> 4. Modify httpd.conf and mod_jk.conf <br /> Ã£Â€ÂÃ£Â€Â‘ Large number of scenarios for the applications use a static page. <br /> <strong>Fourth, Apache and Tomcat clustering</strong> &lt;br /&gt; demanding for concurrent systems, we need to take a balanced approach to share the load Tomcat server stress. Load balancing to achieve about four: the first is through DNS, but only the realization of a simple rotation distribution, can not deal with failure; the second is based on MS IIS, windows 2003 server itself with the load balancing services; the third is the hardware approach through the switch load balancing function or special equipment to achieve; the fourth is the software of the way through a load balancing server, install the software above. Done using Apache Httpd Server load balancer, Tomcat Tomcat cluster nodes can be done using the fourth approach, more flexible this way, the cost is relatively low, the other big advantage is that applications and servers according to the situation some flexibility in configuration. So it is Apache + Tomcat clustering for load balancing. <br /> Tomcat clusters can be used to play the greatest degree of performance of the server, the server can be configured to deploy a higher number of Tomcat, can also be deployed on multiple servers are Tomcat, Apache and Tomcat JK integrated way or manner. After verification, the system response to a large amount of users using the terms, Apache +3 Tomccat cluster&gt; Apache +2 Tomcat cluster&gt; Apache integrating Tomcat&gt; single Tomcat. And using Apache + Tomcat cluster deployment and more, if there a Tomcat is down, the system can continue to use, so the performance of the hardware system is superior enough to the case, you need to maximize the performance of the software can be used to increase the way Tomcat cluster. <br /> Apache + Tomcat to use the cluster configuration file must have httpd.conf, mod_jk.conf, workers.properties. JK mod_jk.conf which is the configuration information, including the path of JK, workers.properties Tomcat server configuration file is the connection definition file. <br /> Apache need to adjust the operating parameters, so as to build a network environment suitable for the corresponding web services. Which may be the optimal allocation is as follows: <br /> 1. Set MPM (Multi Processing Modules Multi-Processing Modules). ThreadPerChild, this parameter is used to set the number of threads per process in Windows environment, the default value is 64, maximum is 1920, the proposed set to 100-500 between the value of server performance, then a large number of high, whereas smaller. MaxRequestPerChild that each child process to handle the maximum number of requests. Greater the value of this parameter depends on the server\'s memory, if memory is relatively large, then the parameters can be set to large, or to set a smaller value, the proposed value is 3000. <br /> 2. Close DNS and name resolution</font> <wbr /><wbr /> <font size=\"2\">HostnameLookups off <br /> 3. Open UseCanonicalName module UseCanonicalName on <br /> 4. Close extra modules in general, need to load the module, mod_include.so, mod_autoindex.so, mod_access.so, mod_auth.so. <br /> 5. Open KeepAlive support <br /> KeepAlive on, KeepAliveTimeout 15 MaxKeepAliveRequests 1000 <br /></font> <wbr /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> <font size=\"2\">Based on actual experience, by the way Apache and Tomcat clustering to improve system performance of the effect is very obvious, this approach can maximize the use of hardware resources, through multiple treatment to share a single Tomcat when Tomcat pressure. <br /> Ã£Â€Â‘ Ã£Â€ÂDeployment steps <br /> 1. Installing Apache Server <br /> 2. To deploy Tomcat cluster, that is more than the same Tomcat. <br /> 3. Mod_jk.so copy the modules directory <br /> 4. Modify httpd.conf, mod_jk.conf and workers.properties <br /> Ã£Â€ÂÃ£Â€Â‘ Concurrent users for the amount of the scene and the relatively high number of users online using the system. <br /> <strong>V., Tomcat itself Optimization</strong> <br /> <strong>1. JVM tuning parameters:-Xms</strong> &lt;size&gt; that initialize JVM heap size,-Xmx &lt;size&gt; that the maximum JVM heap. The size of these two values is generally based on the need for setting. When the application requires the maximum heap memory beyond the virtual machine will be prompted when the memory overflow and cause applications to crash. It is generally recommended the maximum heap is set to the maximum available memory to 80%. In catalina.bat, set JAVA_OPTS = \'-Xms256m-Xmx512m\', said initialization memory 256MB, you can use the maximum memory 512MB. <br /> <strong>2. Disable DNS query</strong> &lt;br /&gt; When the web application to client information to be recorded, it will record the client\'s IP address or domain name server looks through the machine names are converted to IP addresses. DNS queries need to occupy the network, and including the possibility of a lot of very far from the server or the server does not work up the process to obtain the corresponding IP, which will consume some time. In order to eliminate the performance impact of DNS queries that we can turn off DNS queries, way is to modify the server.xml file enableLookups parameter values: <br /> Tomcat4 <br /><br /> &lt;Connector className = &quot;org.apache.coyote.tomcat4.CoyoteConnector&quot; port = &quot;80&quot; minProcessors = &quot;5&quot; maxProcessors = &quot;75&quot; enableLookups = &quot;false&quot; redirectPort = &quot;8443&quot; acceptCount = &quot;100&quot; debug = &quot;0&quot; connectionTimeout = &quot;20000&quot; useURIValidationHack = &quot;false&quot; disableUploadTimeout = &quot;true&quot; /&gt; <br /><br /> Tomcat5 <br /><br /> &lt;Connector port = &quot;80&quot; maxThreads = &quot;150&quot; minSpareThreads = &quot;25&quot; maxSpareThreads = &quot;75&quot; enableLookups = &quot;false&quot; redirectPort = &quot;8443&quot; acceptCount = &quot;100&quot; debug = &quot;0&quot; connectionTimeout = &quot;20000&quot; disableUploadTimeout = &quot; true &quot;/&gt;</font> </p><p><br /> <strong>3.</strong> &lt;br /&gt; By <strong>adjusting the number of threads</strong> the application\'s connector (Connector) control the parameters of performance is to create a number of threads to process the request. Tomcat uses a thread pool to accelerate response time to process the request. In the Java runtime in the thread is the path in a program independent of the other threads of control that can operate independently of the code. They share the same address space. To help programmers write multi-threaded CPU maximum utilization of the efficient processes that maintain a minimum idle time to accept more requests. <br /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> Tomcat4 can modify minProcessors and maxProc'),(241,'linux','en','/a/db/oracle/2010/0421/13.html','TNS-12555: TNS: permission denied error solution','2010-04-21','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><div> <font face=\"Tahoma\" size=\"2\">Oracle 10g + Redhat5, all the normal installation, install the user oracle. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Sqlplus oracle user to start today with the normal <br /> [Abc @ rhel4 admin] $ sqlplus / as sysdba <br /> SQL * Plus: Release 10.2.0.1.0 - Production on Thu Apr 23 12:11:25 2009 <br /> Copyright (c) 1982, 2005, Oracle.

Linux system administrators may often encounter system instability, slow response and other issues, such as linux on a web service built, often can not open the page, and so slow to open, while experiencing these problems, some people will complain about linux system is not good, in fact, these are superficial. Operating system to complete a task, and the system itself settings, network topology, routing equipment, routing strategies, access equipment, and other aspects of the physical line is closely related to any aspect of a problem, it will affect the whole system performance. So when a problem occurs linux applications, it should be from the application, operating system, server hardware, network environment, comprehensive investigation, in which part of the positioning problems, and then concentrate on solving. <br /> In the application, operating system, server hardware, network environment, etc., affect the performance of most applications and operating systems are two aspects, because these two aspects of the problems difficult to detect, very subtle. The hardware, network problems as long as they are generally able to immediately locate. This chapter explains the main idea of the operating system\'s performance tuning, application specific problems need specific treatment. <br /><br /> Resolve system performance issues affect the general idea of the operating system from the performance of the following factors, performance optimization tools, system performance evaluation criteria introduced three Linux-optimized general ideas and methods. <br /><br /> <strong>Factors that affect the Linux performance</strong> <br /> <strong>1. CPU</strong> <br /> CPU is a fundamental and stable operation of the operating system, CPU speed and performance of a large part determines the overall system performance, therefore, cpu more the number the higher the frequency, the server also has a better performance. But that is not exactly true. <br /> Currently, most CPU can only run at the same time, a thread, Hyper-Threading processor can run multiple threads at the same time, therefore, can take advantage of Hyper-Threading processor features to improve system performance, in the linux system, only to run SMP kernel to support Hyper-Threading, but the greater the number of the installed CPU, Hyper-Threading obtained from the improved performance less. In addition, Linux kernel will multi-core processors as multiple separate CPU to identify, for example, two 4-core CPU, will be recognized in the linux system to eight CPU. But from a performance point of view, two 4-core CPU and eight single-core CPU is not completely equivalent, according to authorities test the conclusions drawn from the former than the latter to the overall performance of 25% -30%. <br /> The application may be a CPU bottleneck mail server, dynamic web servers, etc., for such applications should CPU configuration and performance on the main position. <br /> <strong>2. Memory <br /></strong> Linux memory size is also affected an important factor in performance, memory is too small, the system process will be blocked, the application will also become slow, or even loss of response, the memory is too large, resulting in waste of resources. Linux system uses the physical memory and virtual memory concepts, virtual memory, although you can ease the shortage of physical memory, but take up too much virtual memory, application performance will fall significantly, to ensure high-performance applications to run, physical memory must should be large enough, but too much physical memory will cause a waste of memory resources, such as 32-bit processor in a Linux operating system, more than 8G of physical memory will be wasted. Therefore, to use more memory, it is recommended to install 64-bit operating system, and open the linux kernel to support the large memory. <br /> Since the processor addressing range of restrictions, 32-bit linux operating system, applications can only use a single process the maximum 2G memory, so since, even if the system has more memory, the application can not &quot;enjoy&quot; using address approach is to use 64 as the processor, install the 64-bit operating system, the 64-bit operating system, all applications meet the demand for the use of memory [g1], almost no restrictions. <br /> Potential application performance bottlenecks of memory with print server, database server, static web servers, etc., for such applications on the main memory size should position. <br /> <strong>3. Disk I / O bandwidth</strong> &lt;br /&gt; disk I / O performance directly affects the performance of the application, read and write in the application of a frequent, if the disk I / O performance are not met, the application will lead to stagnation. Fortunately, today\'s disks are used a lot of ways to improve the I / O performance, such as the common disk RAID technology. <br /> Full name in English RAID: Redundant Array of Independent Disks. Translated into Chinese is the redundant array of independent disks, called disk arrays. Through the multi-block independent RAID disk (physical disk) in different combinations to form a disk group (logical drives), which provides more than a single disk I / O performance and data redundancy. <br /> RAID technology components through the disk group, the equivalent of a large hard drive, users can partition it format, a file system, etc, with the same single physical hard drive, the only difference is that RAID disk group, I / O performance than a single hard disk is much higher, while data security is also a great improvement. <br /> Different combinations according to the disk, RAID can be divided into RAID0, RAID1, RAID2, RAID3, RAID4, RAID5, RAID6, RAID7, RAID0 +1, RAID10 and other levels, commonly used RAID levels are RAID0, RAID1, RAID5, RAID0 +1, here briefly as follows: <br /> l RAID 0: By bonding multiple hard drives into a larger hard drive group, increased disk performance and throughput. This Fangshi low cost, requires at least two disks, but no fault tolerance and data recovery capabilities, which can only be used for less demanding data security environment. <br /> l RAID 1: disk mirroring is, by mirroring the data from one disk to another disk, disk to ensure maximum data reliability and recoverability, high data redundancy, but only the disk utilization 50%, and therefore, the highest cost, the use of the occasion in preserving important data. <br /> l RAID5: use of sub-additive odd parity disk technology to improve system reliability, RAID5 efficient read, write efficiency in general, at least three disks. Allow a disk failure, without affecting data availability. <br /> l RAID0 +1: the combination of RAID0 and RAID1 technology became RAID0 +1, at least 4 hard drives. In addition to the distribution of data in this way in a number of disc, each disc has its mirror disk, to provide full redundancy, while allowing a disk failure, without affecting data availability and fast read / write capability. <br /> Through the introduction of various RAID levels, we can apply the different characteristics of RAID to choose their own level, to ensure applications achieve optimal disk performance. <br /> <strong>4. Network I / O bandwidth</strong> <br /> Applications under Linux in general are based on the network, so network bandwidth is also an important factor affecting performance, slow and unstable network will result in blocking access to Web applications, and stable, high-speed bandwidth, can guarantee applications run unimpeded on the network. Fortunately, now generally Gigabit network bandwidth, or fiber-optic network, bandwidth issues on the impact of application performance are gradually reduced. <br /> <strong>5.</strong> &lt;br /&gt; <strong>Summarized</strong> by the above four aspects of the talk, not difficult to see, between each area are interdependent, can not be isolated in some ways to troubleshoot the problem, when one is experiencing performance problems, often cause problems in other areas. For example, is bound to consume a lot of CPU and disk read and write I / O resources, and memory deficiency can lead to frequent the memory pages written to disk, memory, disk write operations, resulting in disk I / O bottlenecks, while a large number of network traffic also cause CPU overload. Therefore, in dealing with performance issues, we should look at the overall situation into account in all its aspects.</span></span> </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>'),(250,'linux','en','/a/os/linux/2010/0812/444.html','[IMG]','2010-08-12','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<font color=\"red\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Ã£Â€ÂReproduced in the form of a hyperlink when you identify the source and author information in the article and the statementÃ£Â€Â‘ <br /> Original Link:</span></span></font> <script> \r\nfunction selecturl(){ \r\nz=document.body.createTextRange(); \r\nz.moveToElementText(selecturlDiv); \r\nz.select(); \r\n} \r\n</script><script>document.write(location.href)</script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> <strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">concept and function of samba</span></span></strong> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Samba is a Linux system application allows Microsoft network communication protocol software, which is the Server Message Block SMB stands, is the Server Message Block, SMB mainly as Microsoft\'s network protocols, Samba the SMB protocol was applied to the Linux system on to the formation of the Samba software now.

In fact, this is Windows, see Linux Samba server to share documents. <br /> \\ \\ 192.168.60.231 \\ shared directory name <br /> \\ \\ Ixdba \\ shared directory name can be / etc / init.d / smb start / stop / restart to startup, shutdown, restart the Samba service, start the SMB service is as follows: <br /> [Root @ localhost Linuxdata] # / etc / init.d / smb start <br /> Starting SMB services: [OK] <br /> Starting NMB services: [OK] <br /> The output from the start, we can see, SMB\'s SMB and NMB start includes two services. <br /> Then Linux as a client, the view shared by other Linux Samba file server, how does it work, which use this tool to smbclient. The default comes with this command. Smbclient common use are described below. <br /> <u>(1) View Samba server to share information <br /></u> Smbclient-L / / Samba server ip address-U Samba user name &quot;-L&quot; list is the meaning of, &quot;-U&quot; is the user\'s meaning, if the Samba server is not password access, you can omit the &quot;-U Samba Users Name. &quot; <br /> For example: samba requires a password login, view shared as follows: <br /> [Root @ web ~] # smbclient-L / / 192.168.60.231/Linuxdata-U admin <br /> Password: Enter the admin password here. <br /> Samba no password access, execute the following command: <br /> [Root @ web ~] # smbclient-L / / 192.168.60.231/Linuxdata <br /> Password: Direct press Enter. <br /> <u>(2) landing Samba server</u> &lt;br /&gt; If you need to log in the Linux Samba server, the client, use the following: <br /> Smbclient / / Samba server ip address-U Samba user name see the following Action: <br /> [Root @ web samba] # smbclient / / 192.168.60.231/Linuxdata <br /> Password: <br /> Domain = [IXDBA.NET] OS = [Unix] Server = [Samba 3.0.23c-2] <br /> Server not using user level security and no password supplied. <br /> smb: \\&gt; ls <br /> .

(It does not matter if even suggested incoherent cache, Because time is money it! beside the point!) <br /> Connected to the text book, you have only a table and the sequence is not enough, you also need a trigger to execute it!

SEQUENCE CURRVAL always returns the current value, but only after the first use initialization NEXTVAL CURRVAL, otherwise it will go wrong. NEXTVAL will increase once the value of a SEQUENCE, so if you are in the same statement, which use multiple NEXTVAL, its value is not the same. Understand? </p><p> - If you specify CACHE value, ORACLE memory which can be placed in a number of pre-sequence, so that faster access. After the cache inside the access, oracle and then take a group to automatically cache. No use of cache may jump, such as abnormal down suddenly off the database (shutdownabort), cache in the sequence will be lost. Therefore, when used in the createsequence nocache to prevent this situation. </p><p> 2, AlterSequence <br /> Is the sequence you or the owner, or have ALTERANYSEQUENCE permission to change sequence.

Sometimes referred to as node cluster nodes, servers, or server node is to provide the processing resources of the system, which carried out the actual work of the cluster. In general, it must be configured in order to become part of the cluster, the cluster must run the application software. Applications can be dedicated to the cluster software can also be designed for distributed systems with standard software. node linux cluster manager sucked bundled together to form the logical structure of the appearance of a single system, which is used to break down tasks to all nodes. </p><p> Cluster due to a variety of reasons have different types of linux cluster to establish the most direct reason is to share CPU resources, balance the load between multiple machines, more reliability, or failure to provide the host backup system (switch). </p><p> Through the analysis of related software, to achieve the function of the cluster load is achieved through traffic management, specifically the following approaches: direct routing (Direct Forwarding), Network Address Translation (NAT) and tunneling (Tunneling). </p><p> Direct routing (Direct Forwarding) is that when participating in the cluster control and management computer and the computer as a segment in the same time make this method. Control and management of the computer receives the request packet, directly to the participating cluster nodes. The advantage is that the flow is not returned to the client through the control unit, speed, cost less. </p><p> Perhaps we are all familiar with Network Address Translation (NAT) this approach. Address converter has access to the outside world can be a legitimate IP address, it changes the outflow from the private network address of the package, the outside world looks from the address converter package itself. When the external packet to the converter, it should determine which packets to the internal network nodes. Its advantage is to save IP addresses can be disguised within; disadvantage is low efficiency, because the flow is returned to the requesting party to go through a converter. </p><p> Tunneling (Tunneling) linux cluster in this way the nodes are not in the same segment of the forwarding mechanism used, the IP packet is encapsulated in the other network traffic. From a security point of view, technology should be used in the tunnel VPN, leased lines can also be used. </p><p> linux cluster can provide the service is based on TCP / IP, Web Services, Mail Services, News Services, DNS Services and Proxy servers. Here I will take a specific product TurboLinux Cluster Server to implement a load balancing linux cluster system, used to provide Web and FTP services. </p><p> <strong>Planning <br /></strong> 1.

With 4 servers, 3 sets to install TurboLinux Cluster Server, 1 station to install Windows 2000 Sever. </p><p> <strong>Installation</strong> <br /> 1. In the 3 servers installed Turbo Linux, also need to install Apache and wu-ftpd, because the linux cluster to provide this service. After installation is complete, restart the machine, mount CD-ROM in the directory / mnt / cdrom, execute. / TLCS-install, then follow the prompts to complete installation. <br /> 2. In a single server installation of Windows 2000 Server, also install Internet Information Server 5.0. </p><p> <strong>Linux cluster manager configuration <br /></strong> 1.

In addition to writing the code in the gap for those who break the engineers responsible for Greater China and Australia, Zheng Yan, senior recruiting manager will own or even after lunch marked the two Councils. Today, free and open corporate culture more and more present in the enterprise, but Red Hat\'s culture is more prominent. As the most revolutionary technology of the company, Red Hat software product itself for such a unique corporate culture of dedication. </p><p> &quot;At first I did not understand Red Hat\'s open source is, but the search was digging I came very professional, and he told me that the future must be open source world, the world\'s best engineers so much doing in this product contribution, and our code is free to use for the community. &quot;joining the company, Zheng Yan more convinced their judgments. As the financial crisis, many companies have reduced revenue, and Red Hat in the world all achieve a contrarian uplink. </p><p> In China, the report also reflected the beautiful changes in the organization, from the beginning of this year, Red Hat to Beijing looking for new office, because this year the company\'s development plans and last year just as quickly. In fact, in that room with pool tables in the lounge, the walls continued with new recruits Post self-introduction, and this one, many people are attracted to Red Hat\'s campus presentation. </p><p> <strong>Flexible Culture</strong> </p><p> End of last year\'s campus recruitment propaganda, Zheng Yan\'s style and very different from other HR companies. Traditionally, such propaganda in the strict sense should be wearing suits, and Zheng Yan was wearing boots and denim shorts, and her cool short hair style, it is added to this alternative points. </p><p> &quot;HR on behalf of the company\'s corporate culture, is a candidate to understand the company\'s bridge, the day I am also very active on stage, I move around, jump, and students interaction, joking. And we preach the process, to take a very variety of forms, including a video, is the company\'s own making, the topic is the performance of our daily working conditions, this casual and very attractive short positive students. &quot; </p><p> Now more and more young people with personality, how to meet them? Zheng Yanxi hope this message is Red Hat\'s free and open spirit. Many of my colleagues as the company needs to report directly to the United States, so sometimes you will work, meetings late into the night, and many colleagues hope to have the time to write code more quiet work space, the company respect the work habits of employees, staff believed arranged for independent work time, so Red Hat is not used flexible working time system. </p><p> Zheng Yan themselves are the direct beneficiaries of this work system. As a child is just 1 year old new mother, at first, her friends around to the Red Hat development rather puzzled. For a career woman, in order to balance work and life, such moments are usually more suitable for Enron in the original live enterprise Moreover, Zheng Yan, she has worked for a company in the last 4 years and outstanding performance. </p><p> After the Red Hat, Zheng Yan of the great pressure of work, but she still can arrange your own pace, and working hours. &quot;Red Hat is a user-friendly and encourage personal development company, our culture is the most important freedom, because open source is free, this freedom is based on trust, which also reflects the company\'s employees respect. My house from the company very far, but I can choose to stagger the rush hour, so that flexible working for me to win a higher efficiency, but also can arrange a good family life. &quot; </p><p> Open and free culture is reflected in many ways, the flexible working time management is a human performance. In addition, the company will arrange special staff for everyone to buy their favorite snacks, beverages, for staff to provide quality meals. This culture is indeed a truly effective the favorite to win the staff, although the average age of Red Hat employees only 26 years old, but the rate of turnover of enterprises remain a low level of below 5%, which is rare in the IT industry, Moreover, Red Hat is not completely rely on the kind of salaries to keep people in the management system. </p><p> <strong>Within the recommended optimal</strong> </p><p> And corporate values to keep the same people, the source of recruitment is the choice of candidates. For July 2009 to join Red Hat software just Yan Cheng, the company initially invited her rather puzzled. Because that time period, we more or talking about the financial crisis, most companies have a hiring freeze, and she has to do a recruitment focus for the HR person in charge of the work. </p><p> And the recent past, Red Hat\'s efforts to recruit and completely different. Zheng Yan in the year before the company, Red Hat not only recruited 20 people, and she came after six months, has reached 40 people. To attract more outstanding personnel, in addition to the number of jobs, even before the problem difficult to solve the graduate account, Zheng Yan fundamental for the company through the multi-mediation resolved. </p><p> In addition to graduates, the company now more than ever, attention to the recommendation of internal talent. In Zhengyan Gang joined the company when the internal referral system has been started, and the company also provides a high for this budget. Now from the company headquarters to China, we hope to dig more deeply this project, for which Red Hat in the global selection of some wonderful HR to join the project, Zheng Yan is one of the member. </p><p> Optimized internal referral system is more rigorous than ever before, and humane. The key is, the company hopes will be in the previous Red Hat Enterprise culture to candidates, in order to improve the success rate of this project. As employees of Red Hat in the past often only published in a number of industry forums employment needs of their company, and most of the resume is given the staff and Red Hat is not met, so the past success of Red Hat\'s recommended rate of zero. Today, the project carried out soon, already have three colleagues through the way of success within the recommended joining Red Hat. </p><p> &quot;In the past only screening employees, and now we ask to interview each other, thus improving the success rate, but also allow a better understanding of the new employees joining the likes of Red Hat\'s culture, so although the recent time, we increased the number of recruitment Many, but not dilute our culture. &quot; </p><p> Within the recommended approach has been the HR technology companies favored by natural cost advantage is one of the reasons this project to deepen, but the traditional recruitment channels, Red Hat still has not given up. Zheng Yan to the company, will be invited each of the company\'s service provider negotiations and the formation of competition between them to quickly improve the service level of service. When the search firm candidates fail to provide Red Hat requirements, Zheng Yan, and their detailed analysis will be the reason, once again clarify the job requirements, to understand the business as much as possible the intention of the other party to continue to promote their service. </p><p> Zheng Yan\'s efforts to get the company\'s identity, his boss, the boss of the region are working for her efficiency and performance that surprises. Zheng Yan to feel proud of their business also includes the recognition of her head, because the rapid expansion of business, R &amp; D centers in China, general manager of one of the things that most worried the rapid establishment of the team, and Zheng Yan just help to him. </p><p> &quot;I believe the next 5 to 10 years, China\'s HR recruitment is still dominated, as the business managers, HR to help them the most, and most obvious is the recruitment, finding the right person to build a good team, which only after we talk about talent management and business development. &quot; </p><p> <strong>Of boss</strong> </p><p> However, Yan Zheng clearer that, as HR, is not to find the right employees to the company even if successful, it is important also to obtain the trust of leaders of HR, trust comes from the professionalism and good communication, has been for 12 years Yan Zheng recruiting experience, she\'s a very deep understanding of this trust. </p><p> &quot;At this point, I am very grateful to the original company, because where I need to handle larger volumes of recruitment, personnel need to be more diversified, which I accumulated a lot of experience.&quot; Which is a very important one and owner communication. </p><p> Professional competence required of employers in Red Hat, Zheng Yan received the greatest support for his boss. This is one of the most obvious is the boss of her trust. As the boss\'s office office in the United States, so far, Zheng Yan, and the boss has no chance to really meet up. &quot;But my boss is very good character, and she do things cleanly, my personality is also very direct, so the communication between us is very smooth. I soon after taking office, we exchanged pictures. When I select local Chinese excellent service, looking for her approval of some projects, she is very fast to me feedback, as long as I made clear reason, she would say, \'I think you must be the best choice.\' &quot; </p><p> In addition to the support of the work, there are quite a lot of things to Zheng Yan moved. Due to time differences, in the past, Zheng Yan needs about 3 times a week, and headquarters in the evening to meet the various project departments, because the more the project leader in the United States or Europe, Zheng Yan to adapt to most of their working time. And once in a meeting and his boss, the other heard the sound of crying children Zheng Yan, the boss immediately said after the meeting, be sure to Zheng Yan of the day, but their choice in the evening. &quot;I believe it is the management of human, so I have a driving force even more.
