This data can be used for data backup is not very high security requirements of business systems. <br /> Careful you may find, and in this way, the service side and client-side data synchronization in the two intervals, possible inconsistencies. For data security demanding business systems, this backup can not meet the requirements, these business requirements and client services to achieve real-time data synchronization, but fortunately, Linux kernel provides the file system monitoring inotify mechanism, through a combination of inotify with rsync, rsync can do and the client server data in real time synchronization. <br /></p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>','rsync is a Linux system image backup of the data tool, rsync can backup local system data over the network to any remote host, rsync has the following characteristics:Can save the entire directory tree mirroring and file systemsCan be incremental synchronization data, file transfer, high efficiency,...'),(3,'linux','linux','en','/a/os/linux/2010/0908/663.html','http://www.ixdba.net','[IMG]','[IMG]','2010-09-08','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><strong>Why should back up a <u><a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/os/linux/\">Linux</a> <a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/os/\">system</a></u></strong> <br /> An application in Linux system, due to internal environmental impact, the impact of the underlying hardware, external hackers, problems are inevitable, as a system of management, their role is not to ensure that the system never a problem, in fact, is impossible, but in the system failure or crash, to the fastest speed in the shortest time to restore system operation to ensure the security of data, loss caused by the fault to a minimum. <br /> This requires the system manager on the operating systems and business applications have a reasonable backup and recovery strategy, backup strategy can guarantee a perfect zero business downtime and data recovered completely. Because business is run on operating systems, so the operating system backup and recovery efficiency is directly related to the recovery of the entire business system level. So back up the operating system becomes critical. <br /> <strong>Second, the data need to back up Linux systems</strong> &lt;br /&gt; ghost in the software under windows, you can complete the entire system to another hard drive, ghost is a disk mirroring technology, all data can be mirrored system disk to another hard disk backup When the system problems, the backup mirror disk system in a short time all the data can be fully restored. <br /> Linux, although there are tools like ghost, but because of hardware compatibility, such as the complexity of recovery, ghost and can not be good for Linux image backup, and if the Linux system partition is too large, backup and recovery process will be very long, the ghost is not suitable for backup Linux operating system. <br /> In fact, the overall backup system is not a good strategy, Linux operating system does not need to fully back up, we just need to back up all configuration files to the system, so the backup process is quick, recovery is also fast. <br /> Linux system files to be backed up can be divided into two categories: system-level configuration files and user-level configuration file. <br /> System-level configuration file of some major global configuration of the system information, such as / etc / directory, / home directory, / boot directory, / root directory and so on. These directories on the system operation is critical, and apply the settings for different systems are different, if these files are missing, even though the new operating system installed quickly, but also to reconfigure the system to spend more time long. <br /> User-level configuration file is the user\'s business application and system related configuration files that are essential for business applications to run the system, once lost, the system will not start the business, such as / usr / local the entire directory, / var / www directory, / etc throughout the catalog. <br /> Important documents that must be backed up, then the backup directory which does not require it, such as / dev directory, / proc directory, / mnt directory, / tmp directories, etc. These directories Dushi not backed up, because those directories or is the memory data, or a temporary file, no important data, backing up the principle that we must all back up important data, useless data not backed up. <br /> <strong>Three-way backup media and</strong> backup data to &lt;br /&gt;, we must have the security of data containers stored on the storage media from access to the basic requirements of the general rate, storage security, storage capacity of three aspects into account. <br /> Access speed is a basic requirement of the storage medium, data backup is a process of read and write operations is extremely frequent, very high speed access to backup media, backup data can greatly shorten the time, but can also reduce the time to recover data . <br /> Storage security is a mandatory requirement storage medium, such as the unsafe storage devices do not store the media, that many storage devices do a lot of security, optimization, such as doing raid disk array, cache reading and writing. Professional storage vendors are EMC, IBM, SUN, etc., have their own storage devices. <br /> Select the storage medium storage capacity is also an aspect to be considered, too much storage space will cause the waste of storage devices, storage space is too small, resulting in data storage failure, therefore, must be based on the size of backup data, select the appropriate size of storage media. <br /> 1. Commonly used backup media are optical storage media, disk, tape drives, floppy disks, etc., where the focus on what the tape drive to use: <br /> Linux use drives in different ways, tar command is the most frequently used method, tar is mainly used for stand-alone environment, the data directly into the tape drive. Tape drive in the Linux device name corresponds to / dev / stX, if the first tape drive, that is, / dev/st0, the basic operation is as follows: <br /> (1) rewind, volume to the starting position of the tape mt-f / dev/st0 rewind <br /> (2) erase the contents of the tape mt-f / dev/st0 erase <br /> Newly purchased tape, opened to use, without the need for erase operations, while the tape when the data filled, the tape can cover the original data and continue to write, so without any erase operation, the erase of the tape has some damage, it is recommended not to perform erase operation. <br /> (3) the band is about to roll to the initial position of the tape from the tape machine and then eject mt-f / dev/st0 offline <br /> (4) are listed by tar the directory or file on the tape tar tvf / dev/st0 [need to view the file or directory] <br /> If not followed with any file or directory, is to look at all the data on the tape when the tape does not have any data, to do this would be an error, but does not affect the tape used. <br /> (5) backup data to tape via tar tar cvf / dev/st0 [to be written to the file or directory name] <br /> Backup data to tape in two ways, packing tape and do not write compressed package directly into the tape. Here we do not recommend packing the data directly into the tape method. This will increase the security of data storage. Why does not recommend the package back up, because the tape is a sequential write data, that is, the linear storage, if all the data packaged into a separate file, then when the tape failure of any one place, may lead to unzip the zip file failure not available, and if not the backup data storage package, then there are a lot of files on tape, even if the tape somewhere fails, the rest of the files are still available, thus greatly improving the security of data backup. <br /> For example, / data/ixdba1.tar.gz the compressed file is written to tape, and cover the original content, you can do the following: <br /> [Root @ webserver / data] # tar cvf / dev/st0 / data/ixdba1.tar.gz <br /> Through the &quot;tar cvf&quot; to write data to tape, each tape will cover any original data, that is, every time from the beginning of the tape to write the data. Transmission speed of the tape drive more slowly, for not a lot of backup files, backup can be completed in a very short period of time, very suitable for system-level file backup. <br /> (6) through the tar continues to write data to tape tar rvf / dev/st0 [to write the file name] <br /> Because tape is linear storage, data is written in turn, in order to write the new data, does not overwrite the original data that already exists, you can use &quot;tar rvf&quot; parameters in order to write data to tape. <br /> For example, in order to / data/ixdba2.tar.gz and / data/ixdba3.tar.gz backup to tape drive: <br /> [Root @ webserver / data] # tar rvf / dev/st0 / data/ixdba2.tar.gz <br /> [Root @ webserver / data] # tar rvf / dev/st0 / data/ixdba3.tar.gz <br /> (7) through the tar to restore data from tape to disk tar xvf / dev/st0 [to restore the file or directory name] <br /> For example, first there is access to all data on the tape: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # tar tvf / dev/st0 <br /> -Rw-r - r - root / root 320 2009-2-20 10:19:02 ixdba1.tar.gz <br /> -Rw-r - r - root / root 320 2009-2-20 10:25:10 ixdba2.tar.gz <br /> -Rw-r - r - root / root 320 2009-2-20 10:45:18 ixdba3.tar.gz <br /> Now if you want to restore the tape on the ixdba2.tar.gz file to disk, you can execute the following command: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # tar xvf / dev/st0 ixdba2.tar.gz <br /> ixdba2.tar.gz <br /> This will restore data from tape to the current path. <br /> 2. Data backup data backup common are local backup and remote disaster recovery, according to the requirements of the importance of the extent of the data, choose the right backup. <br /> Local backup is to back up data to local system disk, tape or proprietary storage devices, local backup is a level of data security considerations, mainly for system failure, or hacker attacks, data loss situation. <br /> Remote disaster recovery and business data is considered a higher security indicators, mainly to back up data to another city or country, mainly for possible natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, etc., when these natural disasters , the local backup data will be lost, this time to a remote disaster recovery need to restore data. <br /> <strong>Four backup strategy formulation <br /></strong> Common backup strategy with full backup, incremental backup, while incremental backups can also be divided between the cumulative incremental backup and incremental backup, the following briefly under the differences between them. <br /> 1. Full backup full backup is to backup all data, for the Linux operating system, is that all the files under the root partition backup, full backup of the benefits are: all data is backed up, the system can recover any data loss, and recovery efficiency; disadvantage is a longer backup time, backup, a lot of useless data and wasted storage space. <br /> 2. Incremental backup data in a large business applications, the daily full backup of the system is unrealistic, requiring an incremental backup strategy. Incremental backup is only backing up the data each day, or change, rather than the backup system does not change the data, so the amount of data backed up greatly reduced, can shorten the backup time, but incremental backups and disadvantages, that is, data recovery When more complex and requires data with the first full backup and incremental backup data recovery portfolio, if you have multiple incremental backup files, recovery process will become very slow. <br /> A good backup strategy is: for small data and small daily increase in the amount of data systems, recommended to choose a full backup, shorter backup and restore is very simple. The huge amount of data a day, also a lot of new data system, we must choose an incremental backup.</span></span> </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>','Why should back up a Linux system An application in Linux system, due to internal environmental impact, the impact of the underlying hardware, external hackers, problems are inevitable, as a system of management, their role is not to ensure that the system never a problem, in fact, is impossible,...'),(4,'linux','linux','en','/a/os/linux/2010/0831/598.html','http://www.ixdba.net','[IMG]','[IMG]','2010-08-31','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">1.

If no one can ping through the machine and receive a response, it can greatly enhance server security, linux can be performed under the following set against ping request: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # echo &quot;1&quot;&gt; / proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all <br /> By default, the &quot;icmp_echo_ignore_all&quot; the value &quot;0&quot;, that responding ping operation. <br /> The above command line can be added to / etc / rc.d / rc.local file, so every time the system restarts automatically. <br /> 2.

Remove unnecessary system default user and group <br /> Linux offers a variety of system accounts, the system installed, if not some of the user or group, we should delete it immediately, because the account the more insecure the system becomes, the more vulnerable. <br /> Delete unnecessary user system with the following command <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # userdel username <br /> Remove unnecessary system group with the following command: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # groupdel groupname <br /> Linux system, you can delete the default user and group: <br /> Delete users, such as adm, lp, sync, shutdown, halt, news, uucp, operator, games, gopher, etc.. <br /> Delete the group, such as adm, lp, news, uucp, games, dip, pppusers, popusers, slipusers and so on. <br /> 5. Off selinux <br /> Security-Enhanced Linux SELinux is a short, is a mandatory access control security system kernel, the current SELinux has been integrated into the mainline Linux 2.6 kernel and most Linux distributions, as SELinux and the existing Linux applications and Linux-compatible kernel module There are still some issues of sexual, it is recommended for beginners to close selinux, until linux has in-depth understanding of, and then not later than on the selinux-depth study! <br /> View selinux is enabled linux system, you can use getenforce command: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # getenforce <br /> Disabled <br /> Off selinux, in the redhat release series, you can directly modify the following documents: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # vi / etc / sysconfig / selinux <br /> # This file controls the state of SELinux on the system. <br /> # SELINUX = can take one of these three values: <br /> # Enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced. <br /> # Permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing. <br /> # Disabled - SELinux is fully disabled. <br /> SELINUX = enforcing <br /> # SELINUXTYPE = type of policy in use. Possible values are: <br /> # Targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected. <br /> # Strict - Full SELinux protection. <br /> SELINUXTYPE = targeted <br /> Will SELINUX = enforcing modify SELINUX = disabled, reboot the system will stop after the SElinux. <br /> 6. Tcp_wrappers firewall settings <br /> Tcp_Wrappers is used to analyze the TCP / IP packet of software, similar to IP packet software still iptables, linux by default are installed with this software, as a secure system, Linux itself has two layers of firewall security, IP filtering mechanism through iptables implement the first layer of protection, iptables firewall to monitor the system through intuitive operating conditions, blocks malicious network attacks and protect the normal operation of the entire system, from attack and destruction. About iptables implementation, described in detail in the next chapters. If the passage of the first layer of protection, then the next layer of protection is tcp_wrappers, and the system can be achieved through Tcp_Wrappers some of the services provided in the opening and closing, permitted and prohibited, so as to more effectively ensure the safe operation of the system. <br /> Tcp_Wrappers the use of very simple, just two configuration files: / etc / hosts.allow and / etc / hosts.deny <br /> (1) Check whether the system is installed Tcp_Wrappers <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-q tcp_wrappers or <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-qa | grep tcp <br /> tcp_wrappers-7.6-37.2 <br /> tcpdump-3.8.2-10.RHEL4 <br /> If there is a similar output of the above, that system has been installed tcp_wrappers module. If not, may not be installed, you can find the installation disk from a linux system, the corresponding RPM package installed. <br /> (2) tcp_wrappers firewall limitations of the system can use a service tcp_wrappers firewall, depending on whether the service applied libwrapped library file, if the application can use the tcp_wrappers a firewall, the system default of some services such as: sshd, portmap, sendmail, xinetd, vsftpd, tcpd so you can use the tcp_wrappers firewall. <br /> (3) tcp_wrappers set of rules <br /> tcp_wrappers achieved through the firewall / etc / hosts.allow and / etc / hosts.deny to complete the two files, first look at the set of formats: <br /> service: host (s) [: action] <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ service: service name on behalf of, such as sshd, vsftpd, sendmail and so on. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ host (s): host name or IP address, you can have more than one, such as 192.168.60.0, www.ixdba.net <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ action: action, meet the conditions of the action taken. <br /> A few keywords: <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ ALL: all services or all of the IP. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ ALL EXCEPT: all services or all of the IP to remove specified. <br /> For example: ALL: ALL EXCEPT 192.168.60.132 <br /> In addition to 192.168.60.132 said the machine, any machine or perform all services allowed or denied. <br /> Understand the set syntax, the following can be accessed on the service limit. <br /> For example, a linux server on the Internet to achieve the goal: only allow 222.90.66.4,61.185.224.66 services and domain name softpark.com Telnet through SSH to the system, set the following: <br /> First set the computer to allow log on, the configuration / etc / hosts.allow files, settings, very simple, just modify / etc / hosts.allow (If you do not have this file, please create your own) this file. <br /> Just add the following rules / etc / hosts.allow to. <br /> sshd: 222.90.66.4 61.185.224.66 softpark.com <br /> Then set the machine does not allow login, which is configured / etc / hosts.deny file. <br /> Under normal circumstances, linux will first determine the / etc / hosts.allow file, if the remote computer logon to meet the file / etc / hosts.allow set, would not have to use / etc / hosts.deny files, on the contrary, If the file does not meet the rules set hosts.allow then hosts.deny files would be to use, if hosts.deny rules, this host is not to be limited to access to linux server, if does not meet the hosts.deny of setting, the host can access the linux server by default, so that when set up / etc / hosts.allow file access rules, just set the / etc / hosts.deny as a &quot;state of all the computers can not log in&quot; button. <br /> sshd: ALL <br /> Thus, a</span></span>Tcp_wrappers simple firewall setting is completed. </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>','1.

For example, authorized a Redhat Linux operating system, or a Centos Linux system, as long as your system can connect to the Internet, type yum update automatically upgrade the system can be realized. System upgrade through yum yum command to download the essence of the specified remote host on the Internet, RPM packages, and then automatically installed, while addressing the dependencies between various software. <br /> Manually upgrade is targeted for a system software upgrade, such as upgrading the system ssh login tools, gcc compile tools. Manually upgrade is actually achieved through the RPM package software update tool, so you may encounter when upgrading software dependencies between the software upgrade is relatively trouble. <br /> The following specific about how to set up in Centos Linux4.4 yum tools to perform system updates. <br /> 1. yum installation and configuration (1) yum yum check whether the installation has been installed: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-qa | grep yum <br /> If there is no any indication that the system not yet installed yum tool, yum centos system CD in the installation package can be found, perform the following command to install: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh yum-*. noarch.rpm <br /> Need to install yum python-elementtree, python-sqlite, urlgrabber, yumconf other support packages, these packages in Centos Linux system installation CD-ROM can be found, if occurred during the installation package yum dependency between, just according to rely on tips to find the corresponding package can be installed until the yum package installed successfully. <br /> The following is an example of the installation environment: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch.rpm <br /> warning: yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> error: Failed dependencies: <br /> python-elementtree is needed by yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch <br /> python-sqlite is needed by yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch <br /> urlgrabber is needed by yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch <br /> yumconf is needed by yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh python-elementtree-1.2.6-4.2.1.i386.rpm <br /> warning: python-elementtree-1.2.6-4.2.1.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: python-elementtree ########################################### [100 %] <br /> <a href=\"mailto:root@localhost\">root @ localhost</a> ~] # rpm-ivh sqlite-3.3.3-1.2.i386.rpm <br /> warning: sqlite-3.3.3-1.2.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: sqlite ########################################### [100%] <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh python-sqlite-1.1.7-1.2.i386.rpm <br /> warning: python-sqlite-1.1.7-1.2.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: python-sqlite ########################################### [100 %] <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh python-urlgrabber-2.9.8-2.noarch.rpm <br /> warning: python-urlgrabber-2.9.8-2.noarch.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: python-urlgrabber ########################################### [100 %] <br /> <a href=\"mailto:root@localhost\">root @ localhost</a> ~] # rpm-ivh CentOS-yumconf-4-4.5.noarch.rpm <br /> warning: centos-yumconf-4-4.5.noarch.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: centos-yumconf ########################################### [100 %] <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm-ivh yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch.rpm <br /> warning: yum-2.4.3-1.c4.noarch.rpm: V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 443e1821 <br /> Preparing ... ########################################### [100% ] <br /> 1: yum ########################################### [100%] <br /> (2) yum configuration <br /> yum tool installed, the next job is to carry out the configuration of yum, yum configuration file has the main configuration file / etc / yum.conf, repository configuration directory / etc / yum.repos.d, yum install, the default number of Library configuration may not be used, hence the need for change, the following is / etc / yum.repos.d / CentOS-Base.repo repository of the detailed meaning of the configuration file: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # / etc / yum.repos.d / CentOS-Base.repo <br /> [Base] <br /> name = CentOS-4 - Base <br /> # Name is the name of release in the format that &quot;the operating system name and release version&quot;, &quot;base&quot; is that this section is the base package to find information.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">baseurl = http://mirror.centos.org/centos/4/os/ $ basearch / <br /> # Baseurl &quot;said yum upgrade file on the Internet to find the URL address.

Installation process has been described in the above section, here is not to say. <br /> Since using the yum package Centos Linux under the Redhat Linux installation, under the Redhat Linux therefore need to increase the resource base, the definition of an unofficial yum repository file, so that some required packages can also be installed via yum. <br /> First establish dag.repo, the definition of non-official repository: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # vi / etc / yum.repos.d / dag.repo <br /> [Dag] <br /> name = Dag RPM Repository for RHEL4 <br /> baseurl = http://ftp.riken.jp/Linux/dag/redhat/el4/en/ $ basearch / dag / <br /> enabled = 1 <br /> gpgcheck = 1 <br /> Then import the unofficial repository GPG: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # rpm - import \\ <br </html></span></span>/&gt; <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><a href=\"http://ftp.riken.jp/Linux/caos/centos/RPM-GPG-KEY-centos4\">http://ftp.riken.jp/Linux/caos/centos/RPM-GPG-KEY-centos4</a> <br /> NOTE: This step is very important, if not authorized to import RPM-GPG-KEY, upgrade using the yum install software prompts the software is not illegal, can be seen in context, under the yum in Centos configured time and did not involve to import RPM-GPG-KEY, it is because the connection the official repository for the Centos repository, and upgrade of the system is Centos, of course, without authorization, and here we are upgrading the system is Redhat Linux, but with the resource file is the Centos , it must import the Centos of the RPM-GPG-KEY, system upgrade package is only considered legitimate. <br /> Finally, you can use the unofficial definition of rpm package to upgrade the system: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # yum update</span></span> </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>','A software upgrade to the software functionality improvements and safety upgrades, with the windows system similar to, linux operating system also needs regular updates to the software upgrade and maintain software are up to date.

If the value is not 0 swpd, or relatively large, as long as the si, so long as the value 0, in which case the general do not worry, do not affect system performance. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ free column indicates the current amount of free physical memory (in k units) <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ buff out the amount of memory that buffers cache, generally only need to read and write block device buffer. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ cache memory column represents the number of page cached, generally as a file system cached, frequently accessed files are cached, if the cache is large, indicating the number of files cached more in the bi if IO is relatively small at this time, indicating that the file system efficiency is better. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ swap <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ si column represents the disk into memory, the memory access is the number of swap memory. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ so that the memory is transferred to the disk out, that is, into the memory swap the amount of memory. <br /> Under normal circumstances, si, so the value is 0, if si, so the value of the long-term is not 0, then the system memory.

Sy\'s value is high, that the kernel consumes a lot of CPU resources. <br /> Based on experience, us + sy 80% of the reference value, if us + sy that there may be greater than 80% of the CPU resources. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ id column shows the CPU percentage of time in idle state. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ wa column shows the IO wait CPU percentage of time occupied. wa higher the value, indicating the more serious the IO wait, based on experience, wa the reference value of 20%, if the wa more than 20%, indicating serious to wait for IO, IO caused to wait because a lot of random read and write may be caused by the disk may also is a disk or disk controller bandwidth bottleneck caused by the (mainly block operation). <br /> In summary, in the CPU\'s assessment, is important to note that the term r procs column item value and CPU us, sy, and id column values. <br /> 1.2 sar command to check CPU performance of the second tool is the sar, sar function is very powerful, able to separate every aspect of the system statistics, but using the sar command can increase system overhead, but these costs can be assessed, the system The results will not be greatly affected. <br /> The following is a sar command output of the system CPU statistics: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # sar-u 3 5 <br /> Linux 2.6.9-42.ELsmp (webserver) 11/28/2008 _i686_ (8 CPU)</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">11:41:24 AM CPU% user% nice% system% iowait% steal% idle <br /> 11:41:27 AM all 0.88 0.00 0.29 0.00 0.00 98.83 <br /> 11:41:30 AM all 0.13 0.00 0.17 0.21 0.00 99.50 <br /> 11:41:33 AM all 0.04 0.00 0.04 0.00 0.00 99.92 <br /> 11:41:36 AM all 0.29 0.00 0.13 0.00 0.00 99.58 <br /> 11:41:39 AM all 0.38 0.00 0.17 0.04 0.00 99.41 <br /> Average: all 0.34 0.00 0.16 0.05 0.00 99.45 <br /> The output of each of the above explanation is as follows: <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬% user column shows the user process consumes the CPU time percentage. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬% nice column shows the normal process of running the percentage of time consumed by the CPU. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬% system column shows the CPU consumption of the system processes the percentage of time. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬% iowait column shows the IO wait CPU percentage of time occupied by the Ã¯ÂÂ¬% steal column shows the relative tension in the memory environment pagein different pages force the steal operation. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬% idle CPU column shows the percentage of time in idle state. <br /> This output is the overall system CPU usage statistics, the output of each are very intuitive, and the last line is a summary row Average is an average of the above statistics. <br /> One thing to note is: the first line contains the sar statistics Statistics consumption itself, so the% user column values will be high point, however, it will not have much impact on the statistical results. <br /> In a multi-CPU system, if the program uses a single thread, there will be such a phenomenon, CPU utilization is not high overall, but the system application is responding slowly, it may be due to procedural reasons for using the single-threaded, single-threaded only using a CPU, causing the CPU occupancy rate of 100%, can not process other requests, while the other CPU is idle, which led to the overall CPU utilization is not high, and the application slow phenomenon. <br /> To address this issue, you can query the system separately for each CPU, each CPU usage statistics: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # sar-P 0 3 5 <br /> Linux 2.6.9-42.ELsmp (webserver) 11/29/2008 _i686_ (8 CPU)</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">06:29:33 PM CPU% user% nice% system% iowait% steal% idle <br /> 06:29:36 PM 0 3.00 0.00 0.33 0.00 0.00 96.67 <br /> 06:29:39 PM 0 0.67 0.00 0.33 0.00 0.00 99.00 <br /> 06:29:42 PM 0 0.00 0.00 0.33 0.00 0.00 99.67 <br /> 06:29:45 PM 0 0.67 0.00 0.33 0.00 0.00 99.00 <br /> 06:29:48 PM 0 1.00 0.00 0.33 0.33 0.00</span></span><html> 98.34 <br /> Average: 0 1.07 0.00 0.33 0.07 0.00 98.53 <br /> This output is the first one CPU on the system\'s information statistics, should be noted that, sar in the count on the CPU is started from 0, so, &quot;sar-P 0 3 5&quot; said the first one on the system CPU to Information and Statistics, &quot;sar-P 4 3 5&quot; said the fifth-CPU on the system for statistics. And so on. It can be seen, the above system has eight CPU. <br /> 1.3 iostat command iostat command is mainly used for disk IO statistics the state, but also can view the CPU usage information, it only shows the limitations of the system is the average of all CPU information, see one of the following output: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # iostat-c <br /> Linux 2.6.9-42.ELsmp (webserver) 11/29/2008 _i686_ (8 CPU) </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">avg-cpu:% user% nice% system% iowait% steal% idle <br /> 2.52 0.00 0.30 0.24 0.00 96.96 <br /> Here, we use the &quot;-c&quot; parameter, only the statistical information display system CPU, the output of each of the meaning of the sar command output with the same item, no details. <br /> 1.4 uptime Command Performance Monitoring System uptime is the most commonly used command is mainly used to run the current situation of statistical systems, the output of information as follows: the system time now, the system is running since the last boot to how long now, the system currently How many login users, the system in one minute, five minutes, fifteen minutes, the average load. A look at the following output: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # uptime <br /> 18:52:11 up 27 days, 19:44, 2 users, load average: 0.12, 0.08, 0.08 <br /> It should be noted that the load average value of this output, the size of these three values are generally not greater than the number of system CPU, for example, the output of the system with 8 CPU, if the load average of three values greater than 8 long-term , that CPU is busy, the load is high, may affect system performance, but occasionally greater than 8, the back do not worry, the general does not affect system performance. Conversely, if the load average output value is less than the number of CPU, then there is idle CPU time slice, such as the output of this example, CPU is idle. <br /> 1.5 This section describes the summary above, check the CPU usage of the four commands, these commands need to know is: if there are performance bottlenecks in the system CPU, that is, these commands can only view the CPU is busy, the load is too large, But do not know why the CPU load is too large, therefore, to determine the system after the CPU problems, in conjunction with top, ps and other commands to further examine the process by those who caused too much CPU load. Cause CPU may be due to the scarcity of resources caused by the irrational application, it could be caused by lack of hardware resources, so, to analyze specific issues, or optimize the application, or increase the system CPU resources. <br /> 2 memory performance evaluation of memory management and optimize the system performance optimization is an important part of the memory resources of the adequacy or the use of a direct impact on application performance, making memory optimization, make sure to familiar with the linux memory management mechanism, which we In the previous chapters have been thoroughly described, this section focuses on how to monitor the linux system command system memory usage. <br /> 2.1 free command <br /> free linux memory usage is to monitor the most common commands, look at one of the following output: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # free-m <br /> total used free shared buffers cached <br /> Mem: 8111 7185 925 0 243 6299 <br /> - / + Buffers / cache: 643 7468 <br /> Swap: 8189 0 8189 <br /> &quot;Free-m&quot;, said to M as a unit to view memory usage, in this output, our focus should be the free cached column and column output value, we can see from the output of this system a total of 8G memory, the system free memory there 925M, of which, Buffer Cache takes up 243M, Page Cache occupied 6299M, can be seen the system cache a lot of files and directories, and for applications, you can use the memory, and 7468M, 7468M includes of course the Buffer Cache and Page Cache value. Items can be seen in the swap, the swap partition has not been used. So from the application point of view, this system is also very abundant memory resources. <br /> General formula for such an experience: application of available memory / system physical memory&gt; 70%, said the system memory resources are very abundant, does not affect system performance, the application of available memory / system physical memory &lt;20%, said the shortage of system memory resources , need to increase the system memory, 20% &lt;memory available to an application / system physical memory &lt;70%, the system memory resources that can meet the basic application requirements, the temporary does not affect system performance. <br /> free command can also be timely monitoring memory usage, use the &quot;-s&quot; parameter you can specify the time period in the continuous monitoring of memory usage: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # free-b-s 5 <br /> total used free shared buffers cached <br /> Mem: 8505901056 7528706048 977195008 0 260112384 6601158656 <br /> - / + Buffers / cache: 667435008 7838466048 <br /> Swap: 8587149312 163840 8586985472</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">total used free shared buffers cached <br /> Mem: 8505901056 7526936576 978964480 0 260128768 6601142272 <br /> - / + Buffers / cache: 665665536 7840235520 <br /> Swap: 8587149312 163840 8586985472</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">total used free shared buffers cached <br /> Mem: 8505901056 7523987456 981913600 0 260141056 6601129984 <br /> - / + Buffers / cache: 662716416 7843184640 <br /> Swap: 8587149312 163840 8586985472 <br /> Of which, &quot;-b&quot; that in kilobytes (that is, 1024 bytes) to display the memory usage. <br /> 2.2 Through a combination watch and free dynamic monitoring of memory condition watch is a very useful command, almost every linux distributions come with this tool, through the watch, can dynamically monitor the results of the command to run, eliminating the trouble of manually. <br /> You can watch followed by the need to run the command, watch will automatically repeat to run this command, the default is 2 seconds once, and to update the results of the implementation of the screen. For example: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # watch-n 3-d free <br /> Every 3.0s: free Sun Nov 30 16:23:20 2008</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">total used free shared buffers cached <br /> Mem: 8306544 7349548 956996 0 203296 6500024 <br /> - / + Buffers / cache: 646228 7660316 <br /> Swap: 8385888 160 8385728 <br /> Of which, &quot;-n&quot; specify the repeat time, &quot;-d&quot; that highlight the changes. <br /> 2.3 vmstat command to monitor memory <br /> vmstat command respect in the memory, a powerful monitoring system, see one of the following output: <br /> procs ----------- memory ---------- --- swap - ----- io ---- - system - ---- cpu- --- <br /> r b swpd free buff cache si so bi bo in cs us sy id wa <br /> 0,090,644,022,796,155,616 1325496 340 18024148001010 <br /> 0,090,644,042,796,155,616 1325496 320 289 0 5,410,952,877,015,015 <br /> 0,090,644,042,884,155,624 13,257,482,363,872 1,021,064,276,782,515 <br /> For the memory of the monitoring, the focus in vmstat is swpd, si, and so lines can be seen from this output, the system memory resource shortage, swpd occupies about 900M memory, si, and so much occupied, and the system memory shortage, resulting in 15% of the system, wait, this time to increase the system\'s memory is to be done. <br /> 2.4 sar-r command combination <br /> sar command can also monitor the memory usage of linux, you can &quot;sar-r&quot; portfolio view of system memory and swap space usage.

We can see from the% commit entry, memory resources of this system is adequate. <br /> 2.5 The Summary section above describes the memory monitor a few instructions and some common rule of thumb, in fact, arise in the memory system bottleneck has been very little, because the memory prices are low, the memory has been completely adequate to meet the application and system their own needs, if the system bottleneck in terms of memory, a large application itself may be the problem caused. <br /> 3 disk I / O performance evaluation on the disk I / O performance for evaluation, you must know a few aspects: <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ familiar with RAID storage, according to the application, choose a different RAID mode, for example, if an application is often a large number of read operations, can choose to build RAID5 disk array data storage means, if a large number of applications, and frequently writes , you can choose raid0 access mode, if the application of high data security requirements, while also reading and writing requirements, consider raid01 access modes. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ memory read and write as much as possible instead of directly with the disk I / O, so that frequently accessed files or data processing operation into the memory, because memory reads and writes directly to disk to read and write than the efficiency of thousands of times higher. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ will often read and write files with long file the same independent, were placed to a different disk device. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ writes frequently for the data, consider using raw device instead of file system. Briefly described here, the file system and raw device comparison: <br /> The advantages of using the raw device: <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ data can be directly read and write, does not require operating system-level cache, saving memory resources, memory resources to avoid contention. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ the file system level to avoid the maintenance overhead, such as file systems need to maintain a super block, I-node and so on. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ the operating system\'s cache to avoid pre-read function, reduces the I / O requests. <br /> The drawback is that using the raw device: <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ data management, space management is not flexible, very professional people who need to operate. <br /> In fact, the advantage is the raw device file system disadvantage, and vice versa is also true, which requires us to make rational planning and measurement, according to application requirements, make corresponding policies. <br /> Disk IO then introduced the following evaluation criteria. <br /> 3.1 sar-d command combined through the &quot;sar-d&quot; combination, the system can do a basic disk IO statistics, see one of the following output: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # sar-d 2 3 <br /> Linux 2.6.9-42.ELsmp (webserver) 11/30/2008 _i686_ (8 CPU)</span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">11:09:33 PM DEV tps rd_sec / s wr_sec / s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz await svctm% util <br /> 11:09:35 PM dev8-0 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">11:09:35 PM DEV tps rd_sec / s wr_sec / s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz await svctm% util <br /> 11:09:37 PM dev8-0 1.00 0.00 12.00 12.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">11:09:37 PM DEV tps rd_sec / s wr_sec / s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz await svctm% util <br /> 11:09:39 PM dev8-0 1.99 0.00 47.76 24.00 0.00 0.50 0.25 0.05</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Average: DEV tps rd_sec / s wr_sec / s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz await svctm% util <br /> Average: dev8-0 1.00 0.00 19.97 20.00 0.00 0.33 0.17 0.02 <br /> The output of each of the above explanation is as follows: <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ DEV that the disk device name. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ tps said second transmission to the physical disk number, which is the second of I / O traffic. A transfer is an I / O requests, a number of logical requests can be combined into a single physical I / O requests. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ rd_sec / s read from the device, said second number of sectors (1 sector = 512 bytes). <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ wr_sec / s that the number of sectors written to the device per second. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ avgrq-sz that the average per device I / O operations of the data size (in sectors). <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ avgqu-sz that the average I / O queue length. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ await that the average per device I / O operations waiting time (in milliseconds). <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ svctm that the average per device I / O operation of the service time (in milliseconds). <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬% util a few percent of that one second of time for I / O operations. <br /> Linux in the I / O request system and the real-life supermarket queuing systems have many similar places, supermarket queuing system by understanding, can quickly grasp the linux in the I / O operation mechanism. For example: <br /> avgrq-sz similar to queue in the supermarket to buy things by how much per person. <br /> avgqu-sz similar to the supermarket queue in the queue per unit time the average number of people. <br /> await similar to the supermarket queue waiting time in each. <br /> svctm queue in the supermarket cashier similar to the collection rate. <br /> % Util similar to the supermarket checkout line was the percentage of time. <br /> On the disk IO performance, the following general criteria: <br /> Under normal circumstances svctm value should be less than await, and svctm on the size and disk performance, CPU, memory load will affect the value of svctm, too many requests will result in svctm indirect increase in the value. <br /> await the general size of the value depends on the value of svctm and I / O queue length and the I / O request mode, if the value svctm await very close, indicating almost no I / O waits, disk performance, well, if the value is far await higher than the svctm value, then the I / O queues to wait too long, the application running on the system slows down, then you can replace the hard drive to solve the problem faster. <br /> % Util key is to measure the value of disk I / O is an important indicator of close to 100% if% util that generated disk I / O requests are too many, I / O system has been in full work load, the disk bottlenecks may exist . Long-term effect is bound to affect system performance, you can optimize the program or by replacing the higher, faster disk to resolve this issue. <br /> 3.2 iostat-d command combined through the &quot;iostat-d&quot; command combination can also view the system disk usage, see the following output: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # iostat-d 2 3 <br /> Linux 2.6.9-42.ELsmp (webserver) 12/01/2008 _i686_ (8 CPU)</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Device: tps Blk_read / s Blk_wrtn / s Blk_read Blk_wrtn <br /> sda 1.87 2.58 114.12 6479 462 286537372</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Device: tps Blk_read / s Blk_wrtn / s Blk_read Blk_wrtn <br /> sda 0.00 0.00 0.00 0 0</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Device: tps Blk_read / s Blk_wrtn / s Blk_read Blk_wrtn <br /> sda 1.00 0.00 12.00 0 24 <br /> The output of each of the above explanation is as follows: <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ Blk_read / s that the number of data blocks read per second. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ Blk_wrtn / s data indicated that the number of blocks written per second. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ Blk_read that the number of blocks to read all written Ã¯ÂÂ¬ Blk_wrtn that all blocks. <br /> One thing to note here is: the above output from the first since the start of the system to transmit information all the time of enumeration, the data output from the second testing period was representative of the transmission system of values. <br /> By Blk_read / s and Blk_wrtn / s read and write the value of the performance of the disk have a basic understanding, if Blk_wrtn / s worth a lot of that is very frequent disk writes, disk optimization, or optimization can be considered</span></span>Procedure, if Blk_read / s worth a lot, said a lot of disk read operations directly, the data can be read into memory to operate. The value of these options do not have a fixed size, depending on the system the application, have different values, but there is still a rule to follow: the long-term, large data reading and writing is certainly not normal, This situation will certainly affect the system performance. <br /> &quot;Iostat-x&quot; combination also provides separate statistics for each disk, if you do not specify the disk, the default is for all disk statistics, see one of the following output: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # iostat-x / dev / sda 2 3 <br /> Linux 2.6.9-42.ELsmp (webserver) 12/01/2008 _i686_ (8 CPU) </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">avg-cpu:% user% nice% system% iowait% steal% idle <br /> 2.45 0.00 0.30 0.24 0.00 97.03</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">Device: rrqm / s wrqm / s r / s w / s rsec / s wsec / s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz await svctm% util <br /> sda 0.01 12.48 0.10 1.78 2.58 114.03 62.33 0.07 38.39 1.30 0.24</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">avg-cpu:% user% nice% system% iowait% steal% idle <br /> 3.97 0.00 1.83 8.19 0.00 86.14</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">Device: rrqm / s wrqm / s r / s w / s rsec / s wsec / s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz await svctm% util <br /> sda 0.00 195.00 0.00 18.00 0.00 1704.00 94.67 0.04 2.50 0.11 0.20</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">avg-cpu:% user% nice% system% iowait% steal% idle <br /> 4.04 0.00 1.83 8.01 0.00 86.18</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">Device: rrqm / s wrqm / s r / s w / s rsec / s wsec / s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz await svctm% util <br /> sda 0.00 4.50 0.00 7.00 0.00 92.00 13.14 0.01 0.79 0.14 0.10 <br /> The output of the basic and &quot;sar-d&quot; the same, a description of the meaning of several options: <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ rrqm / s were merged per second that the number of read operations. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ wrqm / s per second to merge, said the number of write operations. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ r / s, said second complete reading I / O device number. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ w / s per second to complete that write I / O device number. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ rsec / s that the number of sectors per read. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ wsec / s per second write that the number of sectors. <br /> 3.3 vmstat-d portfolio through the &quot;vmstat-d&quot; combination can also check the disk statistics, the situation is one of the following output:</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">[Root @ webserver ~] # vmstat-d 3 2 | grep sda <br /> disk------------- reads ------------ ------------ writes ---------- - ----- IO ------ <br /> total merged sectors ms total merged sectors ms cur sec <br /> sda 239588 29282 6481862 1044442 4538678 32387680 295410812 186025580 0 6179 <br /> disk------------- reads ------------ ------------ writes ---------- - ----- IO ------ <br /> total merged sectors ms total merged sectors ms cur sec <br /> sda 239588 29282 6481862 1044442 4538680 32387690 295410908 186025581 0 6179 <br /> This output shows the disk reads, writes and IO conditions of use. <br /> 3.4 The Summary section above the main explanation for the disk I / O performance evaluation, in fact, measure the disk I / O are many good and bad, with the application itself, but also the hardware design as well as system configuration issues its own , to solve the I / O bottlenecks, the key is to increase the I / O subsystem efficiency of the implementation. For example, the first from the disk to read and write on the application is optimized to perform the operation into the memory, try not to put the disk while the disk storage on a reasonable plan, to choose their own RAID access mode, finally, system level, you can choose their own applications, file systems, if necessary, increase the use of raw device to read and write performance. <br /> 4 Network performance evaluation of network performance directly affects the application of external stability and reliability of services provided, monitoring network performance, the following aspects can be managed and optimized. <br /> 4.1 ping command to test the network through the connectivity of the network if they slow to respond, or connection is broken, you can ping to test connectivity of the network, see one of the following output: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # ping 10.10.1.254 <br /> PING 10.10.1.254 (10.10.1.254) 56 (84) bytes of data. <br /> 64 bytes from 10.10.1.254: icmp_seq = 0 ttl = 64 time = 0.235 ms <br /> 64 bytes from 10.10.1.254: icmp_seq = 1 ttl = 64 time = 0.164 ms <br /> 64 bytes from 10.10.1.254: icmp_seq = 2 ttl = 64 time = 0.210 ms <br /> 64 bytes from 10.10.1.254: icmp_seq = 3 ttl = 64 time = 0.178 ms <br /> 64 bytes from 10.10.1.254: icmp_seq = 4 ttl = 64 time = 0.525 ms <br /> 64 bytes from 10.10.1.254: icmp_seq = 5 ttl = 64 time = 0.571 ms <br /> 64 bytes from 10.10.1.254: icmp_seq = 6 ttl = 64 time = 0.220 ms <br /> --- 10.10.1.254 ping statistics --- <br /> 7 packets transmitted, 7 received, 0% packet loss, time 6000ms <br /> rtt min / avg / max / mdev = 0.164/0.300/0.571/0.159 ms, pipe 2 <br /> In this output, time value shows the network delay between two hosts, and if this value is large, then a large network delay, in milliseconds. In the final output, the output information is a summary of the above, packet loss, said network packet loss rate, the smaller the value, the higher the quality of that network. <br /> 4.2 netstat-i combination of detection by the network interface status <br /> network interfaces netstat command provides detailed information, see the following output: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # netstat-i <br /> Kernel Interface table <br /> Iface MTU Met RX-OK RX-ERR RX-DRP RX-OVR TX-OK TX-ERR TX-DRP TX-OVR Flg <br /> eth0 1500 0 1313129253 0 0 0 1320686497 0 0 0 BMRU <br /> eth1 1500 0 494902025 0 0 0 292358810 0 0 0 BMRU <br /> lo 16436 0 41901601 0 0 0 41901601 0 0 0 LRU <br /> The output of each of the above explanation is as follows: <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ Iface said network device interface name. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ MTU is the maximum transmission unit, in bytes. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ RX-OK/TX-OK said that it has the accuracy of the received / sent the number of data packets. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ RX-ERR/TX-ERR that receive / send data packets generated when the number of errors. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ RX-DRP/TX-DRP that receive / send packets of data when the number of dropped packets. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ RX-OVR/TX-OVR said that as the number of errors and lost packets. <br /> Ã¯ÂÂ¬ Flg said interface identifier, where: <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ L: that the interface is a loopback device. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ B: that set the broadcast address. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ M: that receives all packets. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ R: that the interface is running. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ U: that the interface is active. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ O: that the interface is disabled arp. <br /> Ã¯ÂƒÂ˜ P: indicates a point to point connection. <br /> Under normal circumstances, RX-ERR/TX-ERR, RX-DRP/TX-DRP and RX-OVR/TX-OVR the value should be 0, if the value of these options is not 0, and the great So definitely a problem of network quality, network transmission performance</span></span>Will decrease. <br /> When the network transmission problems that can detect the network card device is faulty, if possible, can be upgraded to Gigabit Ethernet or fiber-optic network, you can also check the network deployment is reasonable. <br /> 4.3 through the combination of detection systems netstat-r routing table information in the network blocked, or the network is abnormal, the first thought is to check the system\'s routing table information, &quot;netstat-r&quot; the output is identical with the route command output, see Here\'s an example: <br /> [Root @ webserver ~] # netstat-r <br /> Kernel IP routing table <br /> Destination Gateway Genmask Flags MSS Window irtt Iface <br /> 10.10.1.0 * 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 <br /> 192.168.200.0 * 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 eth1 <br /> 169.254.0.0 * 255.255.0.0 U 0 0 0 eth1 <br /> default 10.10.1.254 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth0 <br /> On the specific meaning of each output has been in the previous section details, and is not to say, here we focus on is the default value of the corresponding row, default entry that the system\'s default route, the corresponding network interface is eth0 . <br /> Sar-n through the combination of 4.4 shows a network running sar system provides four different options to display the network statistics, through the &quot;-n&quot; option to specify 4 different types of switches: DEV, EDEV, SOCK, and FULL.

The default is 1. <br /> For example: <br /> vmstat 3 <br /> Updated once every 3 seconds, said output information, cycle output, press ctrl + c to stop output. <br /> vmstat 3 5 <br /> Updated once every 3 seconds, said output information, statistics, stop after 5 times the output. <br /> <strong>2. iostat command <br /></strong> iostat is the I / O statistics (input / output statistics) stands, the main function is the system disk I / O operations to be monitored. The output shows the disk read and write the main statistical information, but also gives the CPU usage. As with vmstat, iostat can not be in-depth analysis of a process, only the overall system were analyzed. <br /> iostat generally not with the system installed, to use the iostat tool, you need to install a Sysstat system toolkit, Sysstat is an open source software, the official address is <a href=\"http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sebastien.godard\">http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sebastien.godard</a> <br /> Can select the source code package or rpm packages install, here is not about the installation process, the installation is complete, the system will be more three command: iostat, sar and mpstat. You can then run directly in the system iostat command. <br /> iostat syntax is as follows: <br /> iostat [-c |-d] [-k] [-t] [-x [device]] [interval [count]] <br /> The meaning of the various options and parameters are as follows: <br /> -C: show CPU usage. <br /> -D: shows disk usage. <br /> -K: the k bytes per second, units of display data. <br /> -T: print statistics begin time. <br /> -X device: Specify the name of the disk device to statistics, the default for all disk devices. <br /> interval: specifies the time interval between the two statistics; <br /> count: in accordance with the &quot;interval&quot; interval specified number of statistics. <br /> <strong>3. sar command</strong> <br /> sar command is very powerful, is an important tool for analysis of system performance, through the sar command, you can fully access the system CPU, the run queue, disk I / O, paging (swap), memory, CPU interrupts, network performance data. <br /> sar uses the format: <br /> sar [options] [g1] [-o filename] [interval [count]] <br /> The meaning of the various options and parameters are as follows: <br /> l options for the command-line options, sar command options are many, listing only commonly used options below: <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-A: Display System devices all the resources (CPU, memory, disk) operating conditions. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-u: display system at the sampling time for all CPU load status. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-P: Display the current system CPU usage is specified. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-d: Show all hard disk drives in the system sampling time conditions of use. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-r: Displays the system memory at the sampling time of usage. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-b: display buffer in the use of sampling time. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-v: show process, file, I state the nodes and the lock table. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-n: display the network running. Parameters can be followed with the DEV, EDEV, SOCK, and FULL. DEV display network interface information, EDEV shows network error statistics, SOCK display socket information, FULL three all of the information displayed. They can be used separately or together. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-q: shows the size of the run queue, the average time it loads the same system. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-R: Display process activities within the sampling time. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-y: the display terminal device activities within the sampling time. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜-w: display system exchange activities in the state of the sampling period. <br /> l-o filename: the results of said commands in binary format will be stored in the file, filename is the file name. <br /> l interval: the sampling interval, must be some parameters. <br /> l count: that the sampling frequency, is an optional parameter, the default value is 1. <br /> For example: <br /> To view the system\'s overall CPU load conditions, once every 3 seconds and Statistics, statistics 5 times, you can use the following combinations: <br /> sar-u 3 5 <br /> System CPU count is 0, and if you want to view the operation of the second-CPU load, use the following combinations: <br /> sar-P 1 3 5 <br /> To view the system disk read and write performance, use the following combinations: <br /> sar-d 3 5 <br /> Similarly, view the system memory usage, network operation status, you can use the following commands respectively: <br /> sar-r 5 2 <br /> sar-n DEV 5 3</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><br /> <strong>15.2.3 System Performance Standards</strong></span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><br /> The main purpose of tuning the system to effectively use various resources, most of it between the application and system performance integration, the application of efficient and stable operation.

Therefore, the idea of solving the problem becomes very important. <br /> For example, linux system, a Web site under the system, users complained that site access is very slow and sometimes inaccessible. <br /> To address this issue, the first step is to test the network, you can ping command to check the site domain name resolution is normal, while, ping the server address of the delay is too large so on, through this way, first rule out the network of possible problem; if the network is no problem, then enter the second step of the linux system to check the memory usage, slow response because the site is generally associated with relatively large memory, through free, vmstat command to determine memory and other resources are scarce, if the memory resources are not a problem, enter the third step, check the status of the system CPU load, you can sar, vmstat, top, etc. The output of the command integrated to determine the existence of CPU overload problem, there is no problem if the CPU to continue into the fourth step is to check the system disk I / O bottleneck exists, you can iostat, vmstat command to check the disk read and write and other properties, it does not matter if the disk read and write, linux system, the basic rule their own performance problems, the last thing to do is check the program itself is a problem . By this line of thought, layers of detection, step by step troubleshooting, performance issues to &quot;nowhere to hide&quot; link to find performance problems will become very simple.</span></span> </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>','System performance analysis toolsYingxiang above sections describe the performance of several aspects of linux and how to solve these problems, but how can we find from the system is an aspect or several aspects of the problem of it there, which need to use a few linuxÃ§Â³Â»Ã§Â»ÂŸprovide performance...'),(8,'linux','linux','en','/a/os/linux/2010/0817/485.html','http://www.ixdba.net','[IMG]','[IMG]','2010-08-17','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Linux operating <u><a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/os/\">system</a></u> is an open source product, but also a practice and application of open source software platform, this platform supports numerous open source software, our common apache, tomcat, mysql, php, etc., the largest open source software philosophy is free, open, then linux as an open source platform, and ultimately to be achieved is through these open-source software support to the most low cost, to achieve optimum application performance. Therefore, talking about performance issues, the main achievement is the linux operating <u><a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/os/\">system</a></u> and applications the best combination.</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Performance of the system is the operating system to complete the task effectiveness, stability and response speed. Linux system administrators may often encounter system instability, slow response and other issues, such as linux on a web service built, often can not open the page, and so slow to open, while experiencing these problems, some people will complain about linux system is not good, in fact, these are superficial. Operating system to complete a task, and the system itself settings, network topology, routing equipment, routing strategies, access equipment, and other aspects of the physical line is closely related to any aspect of a problem, it will affect the whole system performance. So when a problem occurs linux applications, it should be from the application, operating system, server hardware, network environment, comprehensive investigation, in which part of the positioning problems, and then concentrate on solving. <br /> In the application, operating system, server hardware, network environment, the impact on performance is the biggest application and operating system both because the two issues arise not easily be detected, hidden strong. The hardware, network problems as long as they are generally able to immediately locate. This chapter explains the main idea of the operating system\'s performance tuning, application specific problems need specific treatment. <br /><br /> Resolve system performance issues affect the general idea of the operating system from the performance of the following factors, performance optimization tools, system performance evaluation criteria introduced three Linux-optimized general ideas and methods. <br /><br /> <strong>Factors that affect the Linux performance</strong> <br /> <strong>1. CPU</strong> <br /> CPU is a fundamental and stable operation of the operating system, CPU\'s speed and performance of a large part determines the overall system performance, therefore, cpu more the number the higher the frequency, the server also has a better performance. But that is not exactly true. <br /> Currently, most CPU can only run at the same time, a thread, Hyper-Threading processor can run multiple threads at the same time, therefore, can take advantage of Hyper-Threading processor features to improve system performance, in the linux system, only to run SMP kernel to support Hyper-Threading, but the greater the number of the installed CPU, Hyper-Threading obtained from the improved performance less. In addition, Linux kernel will multi-core processors as multiple separate CPU to identify, for example, two 4-core CPU, will be recognized in the linux system to eight CPU. But from a performance point of view, two 4-core CPU and eight single-core CPU is not completely equivalent, according to authorities test the conclusions drawn from the former than the latter to the overall performance of 25% -30%. <br /> The application may be a CPU bottleneck mail server, dynamic web servers, etc., for such applications should CPU configuration and performance on the main position. <br /> <strong>2. Memory <br /></strong> Linux memory size is also affected an important factor in performance, memory is too small, the system process will be blocked, the application will also become slow, or even loss of response, the memory is too large, resulting in waste of resources. Linux system uses the physical memory and virtual memory concepts, virtual memory, although you can ease the shortage of physical memory, but take up too much virtual memory, application performance will fall significantly, to ensure high-performance applications to run, physical memory must should be large enough, but too much physical memory will cause a waste of memory resources, such as 32-bit processor in a Linux operating system, more than 8G of physical memory will be wasted. Therefore, to use more memory, it is recommended to install 64-bit operating system, and open the linux kernel to support the large memory. <br /> Since the processor addressing range of restrictions, 32-bit linux operating system, applications can only use a single process the maximum 2G memory, so since, even if the system has more memory, the application can not &quot;enjoy&quot; using address approach is to use 64 as the processor, install the 64-bit operating system, the 64-bit operating system, all applications meet the demand for the use of memory [g1], almost no restrictions. <br /> Potential application performance bottlenecks of memory with print server, database server, static web servers, etc., for such applications on the main memory size should position. <br /> <strong>3. Disk I / O bandwidth</strong> &lt;br /&gt; disk I / O performance directly affects the performance of the application, read and write in the application of a frequent, if the disk I / O performance are not met, the application will lead to stagnation. Fortunately, today\'s disks are used a lot of ways to improve the I / O performance, such as the common disk RAID technology. <br /> Full name in English RAID: Redundant Array of Independent Disks. Translated into Chinese is the redundant array of independent disks, called disk arrays. Through the multi-block independent RAID disk (physical disk) in different combinations to form a disk group (logical drives), which provides more than a single disk I / O performance and data redundancy. <br /> RAID technology components through the disk group, the equivalent of a large hard drive, users can partition it format, a file system, etc, with the same single physical hard drive, the only difference is that RAID disk group, I / O performance than a single hard disk is much higher, while data security is also a great improvement. <br /> Different combinations according to the disk, RAID can be divided into RAID0, RAID1, RAID2, RAID3, RAID4, RAID5, RAID6, RAID7, RAID0 +1, RAID10 and other levels, commonly used RAID levels are RAID0, RAID1, RAID5, RAID0 +1, here briefly as follows: <br /> l RAID 0: By bonding multiple hard drives into a larger hard drive group, increased disk performance and throughput. In this way, low cost, requires at least two disks, but no fault tolerance and data recovery capabilities, which can only be used in less demanding on the data security environment. <br /> l RAID 1: disk mirroring is through the data to a disk image to another disk, disk to ensure maximum reliability and recoverability of data with high data redundancy capabilities, but the disk utilization Zhiyou 50%, and therefore, the highest cost, the use of the occasion in preserving important data. <br /> l RAID5: use of sub-additive odd parity disk technology to improve system reliability, RAID5 efficient read, write efficiency in general, at least three disks. Allow a disk failure, without affecting data availability. <br /> l RAID0 +1: the combination of RAID0 and RAID1 technology became RAID0 +1, at least 4 hard drives. In addition to the distribution of data in this way in a number of disc, each disc has its mirror disk, to provide full redundancy, while allowing a disk failure, without affecting data availability and fast read / write capability. <br /> Through the introduction of various RAID levels, we can apply the different characteristics of RAID to choose their own level, to ensure applications achieve optimal disk performance. <br /> <strong>4. Network I / O bandwidth</strong> <br /> Applications under Linux in general are based on the network, so network bandwidth is also an important factor affecting performance, slow and unstable network will result in blocking access to Web applications, and stable, high-speed bandwidth, can guarantee applications run unimpeded on the network. Fortunately, now generally Gigabit network bandwidth, or fiber-optic network, bandwidth issues on the impact of application performance are gradually reduced. <br /> <strong>5.</strong> &lt;br /&gt; <strong>Summarized</strong> by the above four aspects of the telling, not difficult to see that each side is between the interdependent and can not be isolated in some ways to troubleshoot the problem, when a performance issues arise, often cause problems in other areas. For example, is bound to consume a lot of CPU and disk read and write I / O resources, and memory deficiency can lead to frequent the memory pages written to disk, memory, disk write operations, resulting in disk I / O bottlenecks, while a large number of network traffic also cause CPU overload. Therefore, in dealing with performance issues, we should look at the overall situation into account in all its aspects.</span></span> </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>','Linux operating system is an open source product, but also a practice and application of open source software platform, this platform supports numerous open source software, our common apache, tomcat, mysql, php, etc., the largest open source software philosophy is free, open, then linux as an open...'),(9,'linux','linux','en','/a/os/linux/2010/0812/444.html','http://www.ixdba.net','[IMG]','[IMG]','2010-08-12','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> <strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">concept and function of samba</span></span></strong> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Samba is a Linux system application allows Microsoft network communication protocol software, which is the Server Message Block SMB stands, is the Server Message Block, SMB mainly as Microsoft\'s network protocols, Samba the SMB protocol was applied to the Linux system on to the formation of the Samba software now. Microsoft SMB again later renamed CIFS (Common Internet File System), the public Internet File System, and added many new features, since this makes Samba with the more powerful. <br /> The biggest feature is the Samba Linux and windows systems can be used for direct file sharing and print sharing, Samba can be used for both windows and file sharing between Linux, Linux and Linux can also be used for resource sharing between, as NFS ( Network File System) can be well done between Linux and the Linux data sharing, and therefore more Samba Linux and windows used in the data sharing between the above. <br /> SMB is based on client / server protocol, and thus, a Samba server can either act as a file sharing server, Samba can also act as a client, for example, a good set up in Linux, Samba server already, windows client SMB protocol to share through the resources on the Samba file server, while, Samba server can also access the network of other windows system or Linux system to share out files. <br /> Samba is used under the windows NetBIOS protocol, if you want to use Linux, to share out files, make sure your windows system is installed NetBIOS protocol. <br /></span></span> </p><p> <strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Samba installation and configuration</span></span></strong> </p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Our system environment is: <br /> Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.1 <br /> Samba server IP address: 192.168.60.231 <br /> Samba version: samba-3.0.23c-2 <br /> <strong>1.

The composition and use of Samba services</strong> &lt;br /&gt; There are two components to run Samba services, one is SMB, the other is the NMB; SMB is the core of Samba to start the service, only the SMB service starts, the file sharing can be achieved, and NMB services is responsible for parsing the use, similar to DNS implementation feature, NMB Linux systems can share the name with its IP counterparts working group together, if the NMB service does not start, you can only access the shared files through the IP. <br /> For example, a Samba server platform for the IP address of 192.168.60.231, the corresponding working group named ixdba, then in Windows, IE browser and type the following two commands can access shared files. In fact, this is Windows, see Linux Samba server to share documents. <br /> \\ \\ 192.168.60.231 \\ shared directory name <br /> \\ \\ Ixdba \\ shared directory name can be / etc / init.d / smb start / stop / restart to startup, shutdown, restart the Samba service, start the SMB service is as follows: <br /> [Root @ localhost Linuxdata] # / etc / init.d / smb start <br /> Starting SMB services: [OK] <br /> Starting NMB services: [OK] <br /> The output from the start, we can see, SMB\'s SMB and NMB start includes two services. <br /> Then Linux as a client, view other Linux Samba server to share files, how does it work, which use this tool to smbclient. The default comes with this command. Smbclient common use are described below. <br /> <u>(1) View Samba server to share information <br /></u> Smbclient-L / / Samba server ip address-U Samba user name &quot;-L&quot; list is the meaning of, &quot;-U&quot; is the user\'s meaning, if the Samba server is not password access, you can omit the &quot;-U Samba Users Name. &quot; <br /> For example: samba requires a password login, view shared as follows: <br /> [Root @ web ~] # smbclient-L / / 192.168.60.231/Linuxdata-U admin <br /> Password: Enter the admin password here. <br /> Samba no password access, execute the following command: <br /> [Root @ web ~] # smbclient-L / / 192.168.60.231/Linuxdata <br /> Password: Direct press Enter. <br /> <u>(2) landing Samba server</u> &lt;br /&gt; If you need to log in the Linux Samba server, the client, use the following: <br /> Smbclient / / Samba server ip address-U Samba user name see the following Action: <br /> [Root @ web samba] # smbclient / / 192.168.60.231/Linuxdata <br /> Password: <br /> Domain = [IXDBA.NET] OS = [Unix] Server = [Samba 3.0.23c-2] <br /> Server not using user level security and no password supplied. <br /> smb: \\&gt; ls <br /> .

Core configuration file smb.conf</strong> <br /> Smb.conf have a number of default options and, compare tedious, we simply talk in this first look at their smb.conf the backup file and then recreate a smb.conf, add the following: <br /> [Global] <br /> workgroup = IXDBA.NET <br /> netbios name = ixdba <br /> server string = My Linux Samba Server <br /> log file = / var / log / samba /% m.log <br /> security = share <br /> [Linuxdata] <br /> path = / ixdba / Linuxdata <br /> writeable = yes <br /> browseable = yes <br /> guest ok = yes <br /> Each line of the above explained as follows: <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;[global]&quot; that the contents of the following global configuration, there must be. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;workgroup&quot; to define the working group, that is, the concept of windows in the working group, here set to IXDBA.NET. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;netbios name&quot; in the display windows used to define the computer name. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;server string&quot; used to define the Samba server that information, you can easily specify! <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;log file&quot; used to define the Samba user\'s log file,% m behalf of the client host name, Samba server in the specified directory for each login create a different log file host. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;security&quot; is used to define the way data sharing, this option has several optional values, commonly used are user and share, user password authentication before expressed the need to share data, share that can share data without the password. Select here to share. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;[Linuxdata]&quot; is used to set the display in the windows in the name of the shared directory. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;path&quot; is used to specify the shared directory, Required. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;writeable&quot; to set whether written, yes writable, no is not writable. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;browseable&quot; is used to define whether the working group can be seen under the windows shared folder, if you need to hide the shared folder, you can choose no. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;guest ok&quot; to define the anonymous user can login, if the security settings for the user, this option is the default value is no. <br /> <strong>4.</strong> &lt;br /&gt; <strong>Create shared directory</strong> set above the shared directory is / ixdba / Linuxdata, the following need to create / ixdba / Linuxdata directory: <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # mkdir-p / ixdba / Linuxdata <br /> [Root @ localhost ~] # chown-R nobody: nobody / ixdba / Linuxdata <br /> Due to set the anonymous user can download or upload files to share, so give / ixdba / Linuxdata directory authorization permissions to nobody. <br /> [Root @ localhost Linuxdata] # cp / root / install.log * / ixdba / Linuxdata <br /> The above is a copy of some test files to the shared directory. <br /> <strong>5.</strong> &lt;br /&gt; <strong>Restart smb service</strong> execute the following command to restart samba services: <br /> [Root @ localhost samba] # / etc / init.d / smb start <br /> Starting SMB services: [OK] <br /> Starting NMB services: [OK] <br /> [Root @ localhost samba] # ls <br /> lmhosts secrets.tdb smb.conf smb.conf.old smbpasswd smbusers <br /> [Root @ localhost samba] # <br /> <strong>6.

Authorized landing Samba server</strong> described above the Samba server anonymously share data setting method, and in many cases, the shared data is the need for access control, that is, users access the Samba server needs a username and password, the following describes how access control configuration of Samba server. <br /> <u>(1)</u> First of all here <u>to add system-level users</u> to add ixdba1, ixdba2 two system-level users, and specify the working directory is / ixdba/ixdba1 and / ixdba/ixdba2, operation is as follows: <br /</html></span></span>&gt; [Root @ localhost /] # useradd-d / ixdba/ixdba1 ixdba1 <br /> [Root @ localhost /] # useradd-d / ixdba/ixdba2-s / sbin / nologin ixdba2 <br /> [Root @ localhost /] # cp / root / install.log * / ixdba/ixdba1 <br /> [Root @ localhost /] # cd / ixdba <br /> [Root @ localhost ixdba] # ll <br /> total 32 <br /> drwx ------ 4 ixdba1 ixdba1 4096 Feb 20 05:58 ixdba1 <br /> drwx ------ 3 ixdba2 ixdba2 4096 Feb 20 05:50 ixdba2 <br /> Which, useradd is to create a system user command, the parameter &quot;-d&quot; is specified ixdba1 the user\'s working directory, and ixdba1 is to create the user\'s name, &quot;-s&quot; is specified user\'s default shell, / sbin / nologin that ixdba2 is virtual users, that is ixdba2 can not shell landing system. Chapter X of these concepts in detail about here is not to say. <br /> When creating a user, Linux systems will be in / etc / passwd file, add a line to the corresponding user name information, and here we use only the / etc / passwd file, the user name information, so no need for two users Set login password. <br /> <u>(2) to create Samba Login</u> &lt;br /&gt; It should be noted that: the system above the corresponding user is a Linux user, and Samba client connection user is required to use the Samba server, the user. Command to create Samba user is smbpasswd, and smbpasswd principle is by reading the / etc / passwd file exists in the user name, and then set a password, so the system user, you can set a password, you can not set the password, if the password, can be the same as the corresponding Samba user password can also be different. <br /> The following settings are ixdba1 and ixdba2 Samba server login password, as follows: <br /> [Root @ localhost samba] # smbpasswd-a ixdba1 <br /> New SMB password: <br /> Retype new SMB password: <br /> Added user ixdba1. <br /> [Root @ localhost samba] # smbpasswd-a ixdba2 <br /> New SMB password: <br /> Retype new SMB password: <br /> Added user ixdba2. <br /> This is set up, you can use ixdba1 and ixdba2 Samba client login server. <br /> <u>(3) configuration smb.conf file <br /></u> Samba configuration file is the core of smb.conf, set a good configuration file as follows: <br /> [Global] <br /> workgroup = IXDBA.NET <br /> netbios name = ixdba <br /> server string = My Linux Samba Server <br /> log file = / var / log / samba /% m.log <br /> max log size = 50 <br /> security = user <br /> encrypt passwords = yes <br /> smb passwd file = / etc / samba / smbpasswd <br /> socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF = 8192 SO_SNDBUF = 8192 <br /> # Interfaces = 192.168.1.254/24 192.168.2.254/24 <br /> os level = 33 <br /> [Ixdba1] <br /> path = / ixdba/ixdba1 <br /> comment = This is ixdba1 <br /> valid users = ixdba1 <br /> writeable = yes <br /> browseable = yes <br /> [Ixdba2] <br /> path = / ixdba/ixdba2 <br /> comment = This is ixdba2 <br /> valid users = ixdba2 <br /> create mask = 664 <br /> directory mask = 775 <br /> writeable = yes <br /> browseable = yes <br /> This configuration is basically the same with the example above, only increased the number of access control things. Add the meaning of each option are as follows: <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;max log size&quot; used to define the log file size limit is set to 0 means do not do, the default unit is KB. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;encrypt passwords&quot; to set the user password is encrypted, yes that needs to be encrypted, or not encrypted, because the current windows systems are sent in encrypted SMB / CIFS passwords, so select here yes. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;smb passwd file&quot; is used to specify the samba password file. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;socket options&quot; to set the Samba server and the client session between the Socket option value, this setting can optimize the data transfer speed. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;os level&quot; is used to set the samba server the OS level, OS level value from 0 to 255, winNT the OS level to 33, win95/98 the OS level is 1, samba server in the OS level is greater than the value of at least 33 or more. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;comment&quot; is the shared directory to the documentation, they can define that information. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;valid users&quot; is used to define access to the Samba server users. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;create mask&quot; used to define the client-side user-created files default permissions, 664 that the user to read and write, read and write to the user group, to other users only have read-only access. <br /> ÃƒÂ˜ &quot;directory mask&quot; is used to define the client default permissions for users to create directories, 755 that the user read-write executables, user groups, and other user-readable executable. <br /> <u>(4) Test Samba Server <br /></u> Special attention to the Samba server is running, it is best to Selinux is turned off, or require a lot of permissions settings, how to turn off Selinux, please read the book, Chapter VII. <br /> After all the settings, restart the smb service. Then authorize windows client login. In the IE browser and type <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">\\ \\ 192.168.60.231, then Enter, to complete!</span></span> </p><p> <span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\">Finally, there is a little skill, the windows through the &quot;\\ \\ ip address&quot; access to resources of other documents, generally the first to enter the password, then went directly to login without entering a password, then if we want to switch to other Samba users how to do it? You can execute the following command windows to achieve: <br /> First, start --- run --- cmd through the input: &quot;net use&quot; command to view existing connections, and then run &quot;net use \\ \\ Samba server IP address or netbios name \\ ipc $ / del&quot;, remove the Samba server has been established connection. Or execute &quot;net use * / del&quot; Now all the connections will be deleted. Finally, once again the implementation of &quot;\\ \\ ip address&quot;, it can switch the user. <br /> So far, Samba server set up has finished presentation.</span></span> </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>','concept and function of sambaSamba is a Linux system application allows Microsoft network communication protocol software, which is the Server Message Block SMB stands, is the Server Message Block, SMB mainly as Microsoft\'s network protocols, Samba the SMB protocol was applied to the Linux system...'),(10,'linux','linux','en','/a/os/linux/2010/0811/434.html','http://www.ixdba.net','[IMG]','[IMG]','2010-08-11','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> <b><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">ftp Services Overview</span></span></b> </p><div> <span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">FTP, full name is the File transfer protocol, the File Transfer Protocol, is the most common way of file sharing and file transfer.

After pressure testing and certification, in the case of many concurrent connections, CPU processing power is stronger, the system runs faster. . <br /> SceneÃ£Â€Â‘ Ã£Â€Âapply to any project. <br /> <strong>Second, Java Virtual Machine tuning</strong> &lt;br /&gt; should choose SUN\'s JVM, the premise of meeting the needs of the project as far as selection of a higher version of JVM, generally high version of the product than the low speed and efficiency will be improved versions of . <br /> JDK1.4 JDK1.3 performance improvement than the nearly 10% -20%, JDK1.5 JDK1.4 than 25% -75% performance increase. <br /> Therefore, the situation on the high performance requirements recommended JDK1.6. <br /> SceneÃ£Â€Â‘ Ã£Â€Âapply to any project. <br /> <strong>Third, Apache Integration <u><a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/web/tomcat/\">Tomcat</a></u></strong> <br /> HTTP Web server dedicated to handling requests, the application server is provided through a number of protocols for the application business logic. While the Tomcat web server can also be made, but the deal\'s not as fast as static html Apache, and web server functionality as far as Apache, so Apache and Tomcat to integrate, will feature some html and Jsp clear division of labor, Jsp Tomcat parts to deal only with the other by the Apache, IIS and other web servers to handle, thus greatly improving the operating efficiency of Tomcat. <br /> If a project makes extensive use of static pages, a large number of pictures and have a greater number of visits, integrated Apache Tomcat recommended way to improve overall system performance. <br /> The integration of Apache and Tomcat, there are three ways, namely, JK, http_proxy and ajp_proxy. Where JK is the most common way of approach, JK itself has two versions 1 and 2, respectively, present a new version is 1.2.8, and version 2 already obsolete. http_proxy is to use Apache\'s mod_proxy module is built using agent technology to connect to Tomcat. Ajp_proxy connection with the http_proxy the same way as a matter of fact, all the functions provided by the mod_proxy. Just need to configure the http:// into ajp: / /, while the connection is where Tomcat\'s AJP Connector port. <br /> JK\'s connections with respect to the latter two is relatively simple in configuration, flexibility is also one o\'clock favorably. But in terms of stability of not JK proven so, so JK\'s connection is recommended. <br /> Apache + JK + Tomcat configuration: <br /> The two configuration files used are: httpd.conf and mod_jk.conf. Which is the Apache server\'s httpd.conf configuration file to load the JK module, and specify the JK configuration file information. mod_jk.conf is connected to the Tomcat server definition file. <br /> Ã£Â€Â‘ Ã£Â€ÂDeployment steps <br /> 1. Installing Apache Server <br /> 2. Deployment Tomcat <br /> 3. Mod_jk.so copy the modules directory <br /> 4. Modify httpd.conf and mod_jk.conf <br /> Ã£Â€ÂApplicationÃ£Â€Â‘ extensive use of static pages the scene of applications. <br /> <strong>Fourth, Apache and Tomcat clustering</strong> &lt;br /&gt; demanding for concurrent systems, we need to take a balanced approach to share the load Tomcat server stress. Load balancing to achieve about four: the first is through DNS, but only the realization of a simple rotation distribution, can not deal with failure; the second is based on MS IIS, windows 2003 server itself with the load balancing services; the third is the hardware approach through the switch load balancing function or special equipment to achieve; the fourth is the software of the way through a load balancing server, install the software above. Done using Apache Httpd Server load balancer, Tomcat Tomcat cluster nodes can be done using the fourth approach, more flexible this way, the cost is relatively low, the other big advantage is that applications and servers according to the situation some flexibility in configuration. So it is Apache + Tomcat clustering for load balancing. <br /> Tomcat clusters can be used to play the greatest degree of performance of the server, the server can be configured to deploy a higher number of Tomcat, can also be deployed on multiple servers are Tomcat, Apache and Tomcat JK integrated way or manner. After verification, the system response to a large amount of users using the terms, Apache +3 Tomccat cluster&gt; Apache +2 Tomcat cluster&gt; Apache integrating Tomcat&gt; single Tomcat. And using Apache + Tomcat cluster deployment and more, if there a Tomcat is down, the system can continue to use, so the performance of the hardware system is superior enough to the case, you need to maximize the performance of the software can be used to increase the way Tomcat cluster. <br /> Apache + Tomcat to use the cluster configuration file must have httpd.conf, mod_jk.conf, workers.properties. JK mod_jk.conf which is the configuration information, including the path of JK, workers.properties Tomcat server configuration file is the connection definition file. <br /> Apache need to adjust the operating parameters, so as to build a network environment suitable for the corresponding web services. Which may be the optimal allocation is as follows: <br /> 1. Set MPM (Multi Processing Modules Multi-Processing Modules). ThreadPerChild, this parameter is used to set the number of threads per process in Windows environment, the default value is 64, maximum is 1920, among the recommendations is set to 100-500, then the value of high performance servers larger, whereas smaller. MaxRequestPerChild that each child process to handle the maximum number of requests. Greater the value of this parameter depends on the server\'s memory, if memory can be relatively large, then the parameter is set to large, or to set a smaller value, the proposed value is 3000. <br /> 2. Close DNS and name resolution</font> <wbr /><wbr /> <font size=\"2\">HostnameLookups off <br /> 3. Open UseCanonicalName module UseCanonicalName on <br /> 4.

Installing Apache Server <br /> 2. To deploy Tomcat cluster, that is more than the same Tomcat. <br /> 3. Mod_jk.so copy the modules directory <br /> 4. Modify httpd.conf, mod_jk.conf and workers.properties <br /> Ã£Â€ÂÃ£Â€Â‘ Concurrent users for the amount of the scene and the relatively high number of users online using the system. <br /> <strong>V., Tomcat itself Optimization</strong> <br /> <strong>1. JVM tuning parameters:-Xms</strong> &lt;size&gt; that initialize JVM heap size,-Xmx &lt;size&gt; that the maximum JVM heap. The size of these two values is generally based on the need for setting. When the application requires the maximum heap memory beyond the virtual machine will be prompted when the memory overflow and cause applications to crash. It is generally recommended the maximum heap is set to the maximum available memory to 80%. In catalina.bat, set JAVA_OPTS = \'-Xms256m-Xmx512m\', said initialization memory 256MB, you can use the maximum memory 512MB. <br /> <strong>2. Disable DNS query</strong> &lt;br /&gt; When the web application to client information to be recorded, it will record the client\'s IP address or domain name server looks through the machine names are converted to IP addresses. DNS queries need to occupy the network, and including the possibility of a lot of very far from the server or the server does not work up the process to obtain the corresponding IP, which will consume some time. In order to eliminate the performance impact of DNS queries that we can turn off DNS queries, way is to modify the server.xml file enableLookups parameter values: <br /> Tomcat4 <br /><br /> &lt;Connector className = &quot;org.apache.coyote.tomcat4.CoyoteConnector&quot; port = &quot;80&quot; minProcessors = &quot;5&quot; maxProcessors = &quot;75&quot; enableLookups = &quot;false&quot; redirectPort = &quot;8443&quot; acceptCount = &quot;100&quot; debug = &quot;0&quot; connectionTimeout = &quot;20000&quot; useURIValidationHack = &quot;false&quot; disableUploadTimeout = &quot;true&quot; /&gt; <br /><br /> Tomcat5 <br /><br /> &lt;Connector port = &quot;80&quot; maxThreads = &quot;150&quot; minSpareThreads = &quot;25&quot; maxSpareThreads = &quot;75&quot; enableLookups = &quot;false&quot; redirectPort = &quot;8443&quot; acceptCount = &quot;100&quot; debug = &quot;0&quot; connectionTimeout = &quot;20000&quot; disableUploadTimeout = &quot; true &quot;/&gt;</font> </p><p><br /> <strong>3.</strong> &lt;br /&gt; By <strong>adjusting the number of threads</strong> the application\'s connector (Connector) control the parameters of performance is to create a number of threads to process the request. Tomcat uses a thread pool to accelerate response time to process the request. In the Java runtime in the thread is the path in a program independent of the other threads of control that can operate independently of the code. They share the same address space. To help programmers write multi-threaded CPU maximum utilization of the efficient processes that maintain a minimum idle time to accept more requests. <br /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> Tomcat4 can modify the value of minProcessors and maxProcessors to control the number of threads. These values after the installation has been set as the default and is sufficient to use, but instead as the site of a large expansion of these values. minProcessors created when the server starts processing the request should be sufficient number of threads dealing with a small amount of load. That is, if the day occurs only 5 times per second click event, and the task of processing each request takes 1 second, then to 5 pre-set number of threads is sufficient. But the traffic on your site will need to set a larger large number of threads, specify the value for the parameter maxProcessors. maxProcessors\'s value is also an upper limit should not prevent the flow of control (or malicious service attacks), which leads to memory beyond the size of the virtual machine to use. If you want to increase the number of concurrent connections, should also increase these two parameters. web server to allow the maximum number of connections is also subject to the operating system kernel parameters, usually Windows is about 2000, Linux is about 1000. <br /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> In Tomcat5 were adjusted for these parameters, see the following attributes: <br /> maxThreads <wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> Tomcat using threads to handle each request received. This value represents the Tomcat to create the largest number of threads. <br /> acceptCount <wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> Specify when all that can be used to process the request threads are used, you can put the number of processing requests in the queue, more than the number of requests will be processed. <br /> connnectionTimeout <wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> Network connection timeout, unit: milliseconds. Set to 0 to never time out, so set up a hidden danger. Usually set to 30000 milliseconds. <br /> minSpareThreads <wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> Tomcat initialization the number of threads created. <br /><br /> maxSpareThreads <wbr /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> Once you create a thread more than this value, Tomcat will no longer need to close the socket threads. <br /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> The best way is to set a few more tests and to observe the response time and memory usage. On different machines, operating system or virtual machines may be combined in different circumstances, but not all of the web site\'s traffic is the same, so there is no one size fits all solution to determine the value of the number of threads. </p><p><br /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> Tomcat uses a thread pool to accelerate response time to process the request.

Tomcat can greatly enhance the processing performance of the static file, and if you use HTTPS if transmitted, can also enhance the performance of SSL processing. <br /> Usually in Windows, you can directly download the compiled binary version of the dll library to enable the Tomcat APR, is generally recommended tcnative-1.dll copy library file to Tomcat\'s bin directory. In Linux, you can extract and install the bin directory directly under the tomcat_native.tar.gz file before compiling to ensure that the apr library is installed. <br /> How can we determine whether you have enabled Tomcat APR library? Method is to start by looking at Tomcat\'s log: <br /> If you do not enable the APR, the general that there is a startup log: <br /> org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol start <br /> If you enable the APR, then the log will become this: <br /> org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol start <br /> tcnative-1.dll Download: http://tomcat.heanet.ie/native/ <br /><wbr /><wbr /> <strong>Tuning Summary <br /></strong> <wbr /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /><wbr /> Based on the above analysis, if you want Tomcat to achieve optimal results, first for making the operating system and network resources to achieve optimal and best use of the high version of the JDK. A large number of static pages for the system, using Apache Tomcat integrated manner by the Apache handle static pages, dynamic part of the deal by Tomcat, Tomcat can be a great liberation of processing power. ARP library can be used to improve greatly Tomcat on static file processing capabilities.

PXE can boot multiple operating systems, such as: Windows 95/98/2000/xp/2003/vista/2008, linux and so on. <br /><br /> Most direct expression of PXE, the stations in the network environment can save hard drive, but not usually refer to the concept of diskless stations, since the use of the technology in the network mode PC running speed faster than the PC with disk 3 times. Of course, the PC using the PXE is not in the traditional sense TERMINAL terminal, because the PC using the PXE server is not consuming CPU, RAM and other resources, so the server hardware requirements low. <br /> Cloning PXE network is now the most widely used one is the cafe of the diskless technology.

Servername is an IP address or domain name. If there is no next-server parameter sent to the client to use DHCP server address. <br /> (3) DHCP common startup mistakes <br /> A: PXELINUX PXELINUX start very slow loading when you may find that if it took a long time to display similar to the following line: <br /> pxelinux.cfg/01-88-99-aa-bb-cc-dd <br /> pxelinux.cfg/C000025B <br /> pxelinux.cfg/C000025 <br /> pxelinux.cfg/C00002 <br /> pxelinux.cfg/C0000 <br /> pxelinux.cfg/C000 <br /> pxelinux.cfg/C00 <br /> pxelinux.cfg/C0 <br /> pxelinux.cfg / C <br /> pxelinux.cfg / default <br /> At this point, must be confirmed in the / etc / dhcpd.conf configuration file to set a next-server tftp server address. As shown in the example, as long as the following line to: <br /> next-server 192.168.77.254; <br /> B: in.tftpd: tftp: client does not accept options (there is no acceptable option) <br /> Perhaps the course of their work in the dhcp in / var / log / messages to see some of the following warning message: <br /> in.tftpd: tftp: client does not accept options <br /> This is normal. PXELINUX can not seem to accept all of the options, but this does not affect the boot. <br /> C: socket error when running in.tftpd Tip If you see an error like: <br /> in.tftpd: cannot bind to local socket: Address already in use <br /> There may be in the / etc / xinet.d / tftp file in the server configuration error of some options. Please check carefully. <br /><br /> <font color=\"#ff0000\">Third, configure the PXE boot file</font> <br /><br /> After the tftp installed in the / directory automatically create a / tftpboot directory, this directory can be used to store the PXE boot file PXE boot files are generally path / usr/lib/syslinux/pxelinux.0, If you do not find this file, make sure the system is properly installed syslinux package, if not installed syslinux package, there is no pxelinux.0 file, here we will pxelinux.0 copied to / tftpboot directory. <br /> [Root @ webserver html] # cp / usr/lib/syslinux/pxelinux.0 / tftpboot / <br /> Next, you need to Linux system boot files on the installation CD to copy / tftpboot / directory, different versions of linux, the boot file may be different, here we use the Centos5.3 version of the CD in the CD isolinux boot file directory. The isolinux directory of all files are copied to / tftpboot directory. </p><p> <font face=\"Tahoma\" size=\"2\">[Root @ webserver html] # mount / dev / cdrom / mnt <br /> [Root @ webserver html] # cp / mnt / isolinux / * / tftpboot <br /> Finally, we in the / tftpboot directory to create pxelinux.cfg directory and the current / tftpboot directory isolinux.cfg files are copied to / tftpboot / pxelinux.cfg directory, and renamed the default. Operation is as follows: <br /> [Root @ webserver html] # cd / tftpboot <br /> [Root @ webserver tftpboot] # mkdir pxelinux.cfg <br /> [Root @ webserver tftpboot] # cp isolinux.cfg pxelinux.cfg / default <br /> At this point, PXE + TFTP + DHCP automatic network boot Linux system installation has been completed. <br /><br /> <font color=\"#ff0000\">Fourth, test the PXE boot function automatically</font> <br /><br /> Here we test the virtual machine through vmware, first create a vmware virtual machine, and then turn esc key to enter boot options, as shown below: <br /><br /> Start here to choose from the network, and then press Enter, if the PXE + TFTP + DHCP configured properly to connect to the system automatically starts the installation boot screen, as shown below: <br /><br /> Here so far, PXE + TFTP + DHCP network boot Linux automatically configure successful. Then you can install linux through a variety of network system. <br /><br /> Can choose to install linux system by http <br /><br /> Can choose to install via ftp linux system <br /><br /> Can choose to install linux system by NFS <br /><br /> Adjourned. . .</font> </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>','His earlier written an article to share with you the next!

Red Hat Linux <br /> Redhat Red Hat Linux is the first release of the personal version of linux, the 1.0 version on November 3, 1994 issue. Although its history is less than other linux releases a long, but compared to a lot of Linux distributions, Red Hat\'s long history and much more. Since Red Hat 9. 0 after release, RedHat is no longer developing the company\'s Linux desktop distributions, Red Hat Linux to stop the development, and will be fully concentrate on the development of the server version, which is Red Hat Enterprise Linux version. April 30, 2004, Red Hat the company official to stop Red Hat 9. 0 version of the support, marking the official end of the Red Hat Linux. The original Red Hat Linux desktop distributions are Fedora open source community and from the plan to merge into Fedora Core release. <br /> Red Hat is currently divided into two series: the Red Hat provides technical support and updated charging Red Hat Enterprise Linux, as well as community development free from the Fedora Core. <br /></p><p> 2. Fedora Core <br /> Fedora Core (abbreviated as FC) is defined as Red Hat experimental field of new technologies, many new technologies will be tested in the FC, if stable, then Red Hat will consider joining the Red Hat Enterprise Linux. <br /> Fedora Core 1 was released in late 2003, and FC is the positioning of desktop users. FC provides the latest package, while its version of the update cycle is very short, only 6 months. Since version update frequently, performance and stability can not be guaranteed, therefore, generally not recommended on the server Fedora Core. <br /> In fact, so to that, Fedora is Red Hat released Red Hat Enterprise linux version of an experiment, take the user to do the test for Red Hat Enterprise Edition released as a foundation. <br /></p><p> 3. Red Hat Enterprise Linux <br /> Red Hat Enterprise Linux (abbreviated to RHEL, Red Hat Enterprise Edition.) Red Hat is now the main job of the server version of linux development, in the version of emphasis on the performance and stability as well as hardware support. Enterprise Edition operating system, because the development cycle is longer, pay attention to performance, stability, and server software support, version updates are relatively slow. <br /> RedHat Enterprise Linux version is divided into 4 Advanced Server (AS), ES Workstation (WS), Desktop, their difference is not large, only a function of the difference. <br /></p><p> 4. Centos <br /> CentOS full name of the &quot;Community Enterprise Operating System&quot; (Community Enterprise Operating System) <br /> CentOS background: <br /> Redhat released Redhat 9. 0, no longer develop redhat 10,11 ... ..., a comprehensive shift Redhat enterprise linux (abbreviated as rhel) development, and different from the past, the new redhat Enterprise Edition requires users to first purchase lisence, redhat same time commitment to ensure the stability, security. rhel binary code is no longer available for download, but as part of redhat service, but the source code remains open. In this case, there has been centos, whitebox, dao, and so a number of open source in the enterprise version, which centos most active. <br /></p><p> Here is how to make about centos generated: </p><p><br /> Redhat CentOS community to the site download all the source code, recompile. As AS / ES / WS is a commercial product, therefore, must be all the Redhat\'s Logo CentOS and logo into their own identity. Such as the AS4. 0 SRPM original source compiled and put on Centos community logo, so that became the CentOS 4. 0. Redhat Enterprise Linux AS4 Update1 the source compiled to become a CentOS4. 1. AS4 Update2 source code compiled to become a CentOS4. 2 and so on. CentOS is produced. <br /> Therefore, it can be said of CentOS is Redhat AS / ES / WS free version can be obtained using the centos redhat enterprise linux with the same features and performance. Centos while also providing free long-term upgrade and update services. Thus, in many versions of RHEL clone, CentOS is a very outstanding very good. <br /> Although it is a RHEL clone centos, but not exactly the same, said cloning is a 100% interchangeability. In fact, different for centos, RHEL on CentOS software can not guarantee 100% above normal. <br /> To understand the difference between Redhat version series, after all. In fact, we found Why Redhat linux as a beginner to learn the reason. <br /> First of all: in the country, and even the world\'s Linux users are most familiar with, the most heard details of the distribution can be sure it is a Red Hat. Red Hat is the linux community as the &quot;boss&quot;, the U.S. company Red Hat released Red Hat linux is a commercial operation of the most successful Linux distributions, so Red Hat linux issued by a trusted company, Red Hat linux functionality and performance There is no doubt. <br /> Second: Red hat now has a huge network of user groups, network resources, the basic 90% of linux are based on Redhat linux, if you encounter any problems in the learning process, whatever the search network, there are thousands of answers to display in front of you. <br /> III: Red Hat linux version of complementary series, complement each other: If your first contact with linux, it is recommended that you install Fedora Core, Fedora Core installation is simple, good hardware support, the interface is also very beautiful, but also can experience the Redhat linux the latest features; if you have some knowledge of linux, need further study, I suggest you use the CENTOS system; if you are doing linux enterprise applications, we recommend you use RHEL version. <br /> Last: redhat wide range of applications, with typical and representative, many systems (such as red redflag, winning linux, oracle release of Enterprise Linux) are based on Red Hat linux as the base, and therefore can be said to learn the Red Hat linux, will be able to comprehend by analogy, other similar linux system can quickly mastered; around now in general are also learning to linux redhat linux based, so to facilitate communication, learning problems, more easily solved. Redhat linux while installing and using the most simple, therefore, is basically not in the &quot;loading system&quot; to waste too much time. <br /></p><p> 1.1.2 Enterprise Application preferred-suse linux <br /> The pursuit of enterprise-class applications is reliability and stability, which requires the application of building enterprise-class platform with high reliability and high stability. Enterprise linux distributions is to solve this problem. <br /> SUSE Linux is Germany\'s most famous release, around the world also enjoys a high reputation. November 4, 2003, Novell announced the company will acquire SuSE. January 2004 completion of the acquisition process, Novell SuSE also will be officially named SuSE Linux. Novell\'s acquisition of suse, speed up the development of the suse linux, suse linux server, both in the desktop market or markets are more specialized, according to incomplete statistics, suse linux linux market share in Europe is now nearly 80% share, most critical applications is built under suse linux. Suse shorter due to China, while with suse marketing model in China, the domestic short-term can not be accepted, so now suse market share in China is not great, but this does not affect the suse linux high reliability and stability the fact that, with the development of suse, suse linux in China believe that the application will be more and more. <br /></p><p> 1.1.3 Preferred-Ubuntu Linux Game <br /> Speaking of linux desktop market, Ubuntu Linux account for almost half of the desktop linux, Ubuntu Linux main linux desktop, the most beautiful interface, simple yet gorgeous, if you want entertainment under linux, Ubuntu Linux is definitely the first choice. <br /> Ubuntu is very user-friendly installation, simply follow the instructions step by step, the installation is as easy as with Windows! And, Ubuntu is best known for the most comprehensive hardware support for Linux distributions, and many other distributions can not be used or not used in the default configuration of hardware, in Ubuntu, can be easy to get. So you can install windows as easily as the installation of Ubuntu. Enjoy the fun of Ubuntu linux. </p><p><br /> 1.1.4 linux as a server is the trend </p><p><br /> In the above section introduces some of the most common linux distributions, in fact, there are many linux distributions much more common there is Debian GNU / Linux, Mandriva, Gentoo, Slackware, Knoppix, MEPIS, Xandros, domestic red flag redflag, winning linux, etc., and is not introduced one by one, in fact, look at the various linux distributions, linux release is nothing more than moving from two aspects, one is the server market, but the desktop market. <br /> As the representative of the Ubuntu Linux distribution linux desktop market is taking the route, although they bring a lot of surprises to the user, update soon, but due to windows desktop market has such a strong opponent, linux Desktop development difficult. <br /> Version of the series represented by redhat linux distribution now mainly for enterprise linux server market, focusing on development of the enterprise versions of linux, suse linux as the main force also focused on developing enterprise linux above, other such domestic redhat flag, winning linux linux so key input in the server market. linux vendors are now two major release of the linux server market to go the route can be seen as an enterprise server linux has great development prospects, According to authoritative statistics, linux in the server market share continued to increase every year. <br /> In fact, many applications are for linux linux server, this book is mainly about linux on the server for a variety of applications commenced under. </p> (Editor: South African Ant) </td></tr></table>',' About linux distributions, too much, probably no one can give an accurate number, but one thing is for sure, Linux is becoming increasingly popular, in the face of so many Linux distributions, going from Go to linux system to other systems may be confusing for beginners, even the faithful Linux...'),(16,'linux','linux','en','/a/os/linux/2010/0421/10.html','http://www.ixdba.net','Individual works &quot;step by step Linux&quot; again','Individual_works_&quot;step_by_step_Linux&quot;_again','2010-04-21','0000-00-00 00:00:00','script><table width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p> <font face=\"Ã¥Â¾Â®Ã¨Â½Â¯Ã©Â›Â…Ã©Â»Â‘\"><font color=\"#f00000\"><strong><font size=\"4\">Comments on the Publication <br /><br /></font></strong></font> <font size=\"3\">Press received notification of today\'s editorial, linux book &lt;&lt;a gradual <u><a href=\"http://www.ixdba.net/a/os/linux/\">Linux</a></u> &gt;&gt; has begun publishing a large number of long-awaited moment finally arrived, ecstatic, which is sad and bitter and difficult to form words! <br /><br /> I remember the first contact with linux was in 2000, that time was in college, a student from the Netherlands came back, brought back a copy of a Linux version, remember that version or Redhat6.2.
